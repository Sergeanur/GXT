This repository contains decompiled GXT files and a compiler for them.</br>
Run `build_[game]_[platform].bat` to quickly build GXTs for your desired game.

## Decompiled GXT
The GXT files were decompiled into TXT using a syntax of an original source. The strings are mostly sorted in an order in which they were in the original source file instead of an alphabetical order (like most GXT Editors do). That benefits in having related strings grouped together and not scattered around (e.g. vehicle names).


All files where sorted into directories of their games and platforms accordingly.

## GXT Compiler
**gxt.exe** is a compiler for GXT files.</br>
The source code of it and documentation is here: https://github.com/Sergeanur/GXT-compiler
