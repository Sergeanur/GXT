The date went well! Now she wants a lift back to her place...

[GF_0009]
She seems happy enough. Now give her a run home!

[GF_0010]
She likes you! Next time she might go a little further...

[GF_0011]
Way to go, Casanova, she's dumped you! Oh well, there are plenty more fish in the sea.

[GF_0012]
Amateur! RULE No. 1 - NEVER drop a girl mid-date!

[GF_0014]
This is it, she's inviting you in for coffee! Gird your loins for love...

[GF_0019]
That's the spot! Remember; nice guys finish last!

[GF_0022]
She wants you to drive her home! This could be it...

[GF_0024]

[GF_0042]
You the man! Oh yeah! You the man!

[GF_0044]

[GF_0045]

[GF_0047]
She stole your car! You two have so much in common...

[GF_0050]
This area seems to suit her...

[GF_0051]
Sounds like she doesn't like this area...

[GF_0052]

Oh dear, it doesn't sound like she had a good time...

[GF_0067]
Failure to satisfy a woman is a CRIME!

[DST8_19:DSERT8]
~s~There are searchlights sweeping the area. Observe their routine and plan your route around them.

[DST8_20:DSERT8]
~s~If you stay in a searchlight's beam for too long or shoot too many out you will be spotted and the control tower will lock down the facility. This will force you to find an alternative route in.

[DST8_21:DSERT8]
~s~There are also several military personnel patrolling the area. Use the thermal goggles that The Truth gave you to help you see them in the dark.

[DST8_22:DSERT8]
