[E1M_0_0:EML10]
Man, i fucked things up. I know I did. But you weren't a saint. You weren't. You're who you are, and you do bad shit. and hanging out with you made me do bad shit, even though it ain't your fault. but i did bad shit to you, because you were my world. i thought you would kill me and you didn't. so that makes you a better person than some. i'm so glad we are friends now. 
[E1R_0_0_0:EML10]
Ash, Ain't much point going over shit again. Whole world we live in is fucked up and we belong in that world. Things weren't meant to be, and I don't seem to be the family man type. I'm your friend, nothing more. Not ever. I can't watch you do any more drugs. Good luck staying clean this time. Johnny.
[E1R_0_0_1:EML10]
I ain't in the mood for internet chit chat, Ash. Have a nice life. Johnny.

[E1M_0_1:EML10]
it makes me happy to know you're on my side and even though we ain't together and we both fucked this thing up, we are at least friends. i'm off the drugs, Johnny boy. i'm off them. i don't want to get high no more. Not ever. i'm sorting myself out. i'm even exercising. i went running yesterday. i was nearly a model, one time. 

[E1M_0_2:EML10]
i'm going to go to college or something. Give back. i miss you. it won't never be the same without you, but it's the way it's got to be. i know that. we both did bad shit and we hurt each other and people who love each other ain't meant to hurt each other.

[E1S_0_3:EMAILE1]
Clean
[E1M_0_3:EML10]
I checked into rehab again last week. i feel rough, but this time it's going to stick, i know it. 
[E1R_0_3_0:EML10]
Good luck Ashley. Please stay the fuck away from me. 
[E1R_0_3_1:EML10]
I don't care, Ash. Stay away from me. Please.

[E1S_0_4:EMAILE1]
Shit
[E1M_0_4:EML10]
i fucked up. it weren't my fault. i got thrown out of the facility. it weren't my coke. I love you, Johnny. i love you. drugs ain't shit. you're my drug. Listen, Johnny, can i borrow some money, for a few days? I miss you. i miss you so much. 
[E1R_0_4_0:EML10]
Good luck Ashley. Please don't contact me again. 
[E1R_0_4_1:EML10]
Fuck off!

[E1M_1_0:EML11]
I hope this mail finds you well and happy and law abiding. I doubt the later, but a brother can hope, can't he? I got shot at yesterday and saw someone have their leg blown off. i saw three kids die last week. My life is one long orgy of death and horror. At least i know i am on the right side. i miss you, man. You have a heart. 
[E1R_1_0_0:EML11]
Thanks for your input Mikey. I miss you, man. I think about you, but I made different choices to you. Doesn't seem like either of our choices panned out so good. We both get shot at. And both of us are fighting other people's battles. Look after yourself. John
[E1R_1_0_1:EML11]
Blah. Blah. Blah. At least I know what I'm fighting for. Look after yourself. John.

[E1M_1_1:EML11]
What about the life you chose led you to make such stupid choices? Billy Grey? Give me a break. He always was an arsehole. Back in the neighborhood, he was a jackass thinking he was Jesus on an acid trip when we were fifteen and you were 10. That was a long time ago. i hope you don't still look up to that asshole, pardon my fucking French. 

[E1M_1_2:EML11]
You will throw your whole life way. For a guy who wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. I know we've been over this a thousand times, but my life is kind of stressful right now. 

[E1S_1_3:EMAILE1]
RE: hey bro
[E1M_1_3:EML11]
You always were a smart ass with all the answers. i have a country. You have nothing. Mom and Dad were right about you, you smug little shit. I will fuck you up when I see you. Mark my words. Disrespecting me like that. And my country. My country. I've seen men die for that shit, you junkie piece of shit. And happily. You would only die for drugs or money. You're a rat, not a man. 
[E1R_1_3_0:EML11]
I love you, too bro. And out of a place of love I make one comment - you get on some very strong medication to deal with the fact you've lost your fucking mind, you messianic dip shit.
[E1R_1_3_1:EML11]
Whoa. Dude? You should talk to a head doctor.

B.G. out
[E1M_2_0:EML12]
So, they let him out? Ridiculous in some ways. Man, it's tough. I love my brothers, all of them, but there's brothers who stood by me, (you, Jim, Clay and a few others) and brothers who said they would, and I think we know which camp Billy and Brian fall into. This is my life now. I can't ride into the sunset. I can't ride into anything. I'm stuck in a chair and I need money. 
[E1R_2_0_0:EML12]
I hear you, brother. Whatever happens, you know me and you are brothers. Johnny.
[E1R_2_0_1:EML12]
Let's give him a chance, man. Brothers for life. No matter what. Johnny.

[E1M_2_1:EML12]
I need it so we have to keep making it. It's tough. I hope Billy don't fuck it up for all of us. He nearly did last time. We are a small crew. We can't beat the Deadbeats, but we can live alongside them. Billy will come out and go on a rampage. And Brian and those other clowns will drag us all along. It ain't going to be good. It's just a question of how bad. 

[E1S_2_2:EMAILE1]
all done
[E1M_2_2:EML12]
Well I guess that's that then. You did what had to be done. And that's why you're a brother and why it's time to move on with our lives. End the charade that this gang meant anything. Do it for Jim. 
[E1R_2_2_0:EML12]
World ain't what we thought it was, and people we trusted turned out to be scum. I miss Jim. More than anything. He was the real deal. The man we all wanted to be. 
[E1R_2_2_1:EML12]
Fuck. We'll see, man. We'll see.

LOST MC
[E1M_2_3:EML12]
So it's come to this. the Lost MC showing that it was all a load of bullshit and all them oaths we swore really never meant shit to anyone. Well, Johnny, you got my blessing. I'm with you, all the way. If i weren't in a fucknig chair, I'd kill them fucks myself. They ain't human beings, let alone brothers. They are scum. Real low life scum. You got my blessing. Do what's got to be done.
[E1R_2_3_0:EML12]
Amen to that brother.
[E1R_2_3_1:EML12]

Two months ago my client and his entire family was killed in a motor accident on a road of Ouagadougou, which claimed all their lifes, sparing none of the ocupants of the aforementioned vehicle, not one, not even the bouncing headed dog who lived on the dashboard.

[E1M_9_2:EML19]
I came to know your esteemed self in my search for relatives of my client with the objective of securing a destinee of the property and money left behind by my aforementioned client following his aforementioned death, which unfortunately claimed his life. 

[E1M_9_3:EML19]
Knowing of your high trustworthiness and repute, I seek your consent if you are unequivocably interested to present you as Next Of Kin of the deceased so that the funds of $15.5m would be released into your bank account as the aforementioned Next Of Kin.

This Bank of the deceased has issued a notice instructing me to produce the Next of Kin to the aforementioned account within the next four working days or have the account confiscated. 

[E1M_9_5:EML19]
In consideration of my failing attempts to locate my client's relatives I humbly seek your help very urgently with much courtesy and hope to present you as the Next of Kin of the aforementioned deceased as you both bear the same name. 

[E1M_9_6:EML19]

My sincere apoligies for emptying myself into you unsolicitedly and I trust this letter reaches you in fine health. Please contact me at your earliest comfort. You will be rich.

Nadam se da si dobro i da si srecan u Americi. I hope this reaches you and you respond. I miss you. I write in English because now you are like Roman. He tells me he only speaks English now. I know things better for you to be out in world, and away from here, but I miss you. It is mother's duty to miss son. Are you no longer in sea? Have you stopped that world for good, or will you go back? Will you ever come back to me? It gladdens heart of mine to think of you and your cousin together, living a good life in America, and at the same time, 
[E1R_13_0_0:EML113]
Dear mother, thank you for your e mail. I am always happy to hear from you. Your English is good. Better than mine. I am sorry I have not been much of a good son to you, and that I am not there to take care of you, but you know I cannot come back home. It would bring trouble, and unhappy memories for us both. Roman is well. He is living the American dream, mostly in his head, like all dream.

breaks heart of mine to think of you never here. I know life has not always easy for you, Niko. I know you had many trouble, and I know you have done many bad thing, but please know that I am mother, your mother, and I do not judge you. I judge the world for making you so, you who has so much to give people, who is man of principle, who always tried to live the correct way.

Life here is the same as it always was. People argue, the farms suffer, we pay taxes for new parliament buildings and government reports, and live in poverty. For country people, life is the same the world. Please write me. 

[E1S_13_3:EMAILE1]
Thank you.
[E1M_13_3:EML113]
thank you for your e mail. It made me cry. At least you are well and happy. I know you cannot live here and be well. I hope happiness finds you. Look after cousin. He is good boy. I dream of both of you settling down with nice women. It is what his mother would have wanted, as well. I will write soon. 

[E1S_13_4:EMAILE1]
Thinking about you.
[E1M_13_4:EML113]
I was thinking about you, and I thought I write. I receive nice e mail from your cousin. He say you had seen Florian Cravic again. Did he become a professional wrestler, as he say? He was always strange boy. Roman also tells me he has woman nice in his life and that maybe there was someone special for you too. Life here is much same - crops grow, 
[E1R_13_4_0:EML113]
Dear mother, thanks for your mail. Life in America is okay, thank you for your concern. I wish Roman would join me from his time spent living in clouds. He makes things up, I don't know why. He has a nice woman in his life, that is true, the rest is lies. Apart from Florian Cravic. We have seen him. He is very different.

[E1M_13_5:EML113]
 the country flounders, British people come to buy holiday homes they never visit, the politicians argue and we all want things will change. I have long memory. Life always confusing uncertain. Only problems change. We have never known freedom, and nor democracy. Sometimes, I think this makes realist life easier for us. 
[E1R_13_5_0:EML113]
He is not a professional wrestler, but I get the sense he still likes to wrestle with men as keen amateur. We have met many people, but most of them have little power and are controlled only by money. Life is strange here. One friend of Roman's likes to inject himself with shark testosterone. These are the kind of people we know here.

In America I imagine the people must be bitter. The world used to love the, now they are despised. This President Lawton seems like a foolish man. Have you met him? Roman said that you and him were up for a prestigious award and you had some powerful friends.
[E1R_13_6_0:EML113]
The only award Roman will win is fantasist of the year. I hope you are well. Look after yourself. Love, Niko.

thank you for your mail. I am glad you well. Look after Roman. I am excite to hear maybe wedding bells are in air soon? What about you, my son? I will write again, soon. 

[E1S_13_8:EMAILE1]
Wedding bells?
[E1M_13_8:EML113]
I hear Roman is getting married! I am so excited. I also heard you had a nice girl, and you could not seem to commit to her? I wish I could make it to the wedding. Have a good time, my son. I am so proud of you both. s ljubavlju, 

[E1S_13_9:EMAILE1]
Roman.
[E1M_13_9:EML113]
Word in the village is that Roman was killed on wedding day. I know it is true, as I checked on internet. My son, my heart is broken. Please leave evil place. Please go somewhere safe. Please do not caught up in madness. Please do not become statistic.

[T11_15]
Dude, you ever need some help, Terry and Clay can back you up. Just call one of em.

[T11_16]
Now that you're chapter leader you should take advantage. Get Terry and Clay up off their asses and make em help you. 

[T11_17]
I feel like you're giving Terry and Clay an easy ride, dude. Give 'em a call and make 'em help you out.

[T11_18]
These are fucked up times, dude. Remember to get T and C to help you if shit gets tough.

[T11_19]
Good race, man. I'm gonna need to soak all these bruises I got.

[T11_20]
Shit, man. Jackie's gonna kill me when she sees these bruises. Nice racing.

[T11_21]
I'm getting to old to get beat up like that. Good racing.

[T11_22]
I enjoyed the race, even if it nearly killed me. Call me soon, brother.

[T11_23]
I hope you didn't take that love tap too seriously. Nice racing.

[T11_24]
Shit, hitting you with that bat was the best part of the race for me. How about you?

[T11_25]
Nice race, man. You're an easy target. Ha ha.

[T11_26]
I should play for the Swingers after that bat work. Nice race, dude.

[T11_27]
Bad luck in the race, man. You should get more aggressive out there.

[T11_28]
You ain't gonna win those raaces if you're all pacifist with it. Later on, brother.

[T11_29]
Better luck next race, man. Batter up.

[T11_30]
Johnny man. You're the friendliest biker I know. Get aggressive in the next race.

[T11_31]
We should hang out at the clubhouse sometime, do arm wrestling, play pool, or play cards. Or we could play air hockey, play darts, or play pool - shit, there's all kinds of stuff we can do. Call me.

[T11_32]
We'll hang out again soon. 

[T11_33]
You should sleep in Brian's old apartment - he won't be turning up there again. Sure beats that old bed at the clubhouse. 

[T11_34]
Me and the boys have fixed up Brian's apartment after the fire. You should sleep there. It's still a shithole, but might be better than that old bed at the clubhouse.

[T11_35]
Hey man, don't tell Jackie that I stayed in the club. Thanks, dude.

[T11_36]
Sorry, man. I wasn't gonna leave that club. You'll know what I'm talking about when you get married. Later.

[T16_1]
what the fuck, man? Where were you?

[T16_2]
I don't got time to wait around for you all day, man. 

[T16_3]
You're like my fucking ex wife, always standing me up. Screw you, man.

[T16_4]
I don't mean to sound like a bitch, but come on dude. Where were you?

[T16_5]
Hey man. You need help, call me or Clay.

[T16_6]
Clay and I are here if the Chapter President ever needs assistance.

[T16_7]
Hey, Prez. Call me or Clay if you need some backup.

[T16_8]
Me and Clay are here to help out on Club business, Prez. Just call one of us. 

[T16_9]

What's up, dude? You gonna hang out with your brothers soon.

[T16_14]
Man, why ain't you calling? I can take my bitch of an ex walking out, but not my brothers.

[T16_15]
Brother. Let's hang out soon.

[T16_16]
Fuck, man. Let's go out and stick it to em soon.

[T16_17]
Fuck, man. You smacked me good. Serves me right for racing with an asshole like you. Ha ha ha.

[T16_18]
Shit. Was that you that smacked me? Pleasure racing with you.

[T16_19]
I think I lost a tooth when you hit me, man. Sweet racing.

[T16_20]
Johnny K, smacks his own brother in the face to try and beat him in a race. Let's hang out soon. 

[T16_21]
I got you good, Johnny. Don't hold it against me. See you soon, man.

[T16_22]
Shit, Johnny. I hit you good. Let's race again sometime.

[T16_23]
Nothing like having a bike between your legs and a bat in your hand. Sorry if I hit you too hard, John. 

[T16_24]
Let's do that again, Johnny. I could get used to hitting you in the face with a bat. Ha ha ha.

[T16_25]
Too bad, Johnny. You might do better if you actually made contact with that bat of yours.

[T16_26]
You're a pleasure to race with, Johnny. Mainly coz you don't know how to use your bat. Ha ha.

[T16_27]
Nice racing with you, man. Next time try and actually use your bat.

[T16_28]
You may not have won the race, but you upset anyone with your bat. Good for you, man. Call me soon.

[T16_29]
Good seeing you at the clubhouse. 

[T16_30]
You should have said you couldn't stay.

[T16_31]
Thanks for leaving me at the club, dude. Nothing cooler than a divorced man lone wolfing it amongst the strippers. See you soon.

[T16_32]
Hey dude, I oughta left with you. Just left that place with a bunch of debt and a sore cock. Later.

You missed us, man.

[T17_2]
Hey man, you missed out.

[T17_3]
You shoulda been there, man. It was a blast.

[T17_4]
I hope you're having fun, man. Because you missed out.

[T17_5]
Me and Terry wanna see some action, too. Let us know if you need some help.

[T17_6]
I'm itching to see some action, man. Let me know if you need Terry and me behind you.

[T17_7]
Me and T are itching for some action. Unleash us, man. Come on.

[T17_8]
You need some help, just call me or Terry. Okay?

[T17_9]
You ever need a bike delivered, just call the Road Captain. Yours truly.

[T17_14]
Brother, we should have some chill time.

[T17_15]
Yo, Johnny. Why don't you call me no more?

[T17_16]
Johnny, man. We should hit it soon.

[T17_17]
You call that a hit, man? My little sister can hit harder than that. Let's race again soon.

[T17_18]
You're a mean motherfucker, ain't you. Let's race again soon.

[T17_19]
We need a rematch. I wanna see if you're just as cold next time we race.

[T17_20]
You hit your own brother? I'm shocked, Johnny. Let's have a rematch soon.

[T17_21]
How you like that bat being taken to you, Johnny. Call me, man.

[T17_22]
Oh, Johnny. You're an easy target. If you ain't scared, let's race again soon.

[T17_23]
I'm swingin low, Johnny. We gotta race again real soon.

[T17_24]
Shit. Was that you I hit? I hope so. Call me soon, man.

[T17_25]
Johnny, man. Racing's a sport for aggressive men. You should stick to darts.

[T17_26]
Johnny, man. Maybe we should play air hockey next time. You ain't even man enough to swing a bat.

[T17_27]
The give you the bat so you hit people, Johnny. Next time why don't you use it?

[T17_28]
You ain't on the track to make friends. If you need to hit someone in the face to win, fucking do it. See you soon, man.

[T17_29]
Till next time, Johnny. 

[T17_30]
You were here and then you wre gone. What happened?

[T17_31]
Johnny I heard your Hexer got messed up, call me and ill get it fixed up and will bring it to you.

[T17_32]
Brother, why'd you leave the stripclub? You get jealous of my gifts with the finer sex? Maybe you coulda learned something.

[T17_33]
Thanks for giving me some space with the ladies at the club. You were seriously killing my vibe, dude. We'll hang soon, yeah?
