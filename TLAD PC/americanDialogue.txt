[INTRO_P1_1:INTROAU]
~z~Hold on little buddy.
[INTRO_P1_2:INTROAU]
~z~-Come on guys, come on let's go.~n~-Alright man...
[INTRO_P1_3:INTROAU]
~z~Keep it up, I'm gonna push you down these stairs.
[INTRO_P1_4:INTROAU]
~z~Alright, everybody, c'mon. Break it up, let's go.
[INTRO_P1_5:INTROAU]
~z~See ya, fuck.

[INTRO_P2_1:INTROAU]
~z~You do understand what probation means?
[INTRO_P2_2:INTROAU]
~z~Uh... yes sir.
[INTRO_P2_3:INTROAU]
~z~It means that if you continue down that same path, 
[INTRO_P2_4:INTROAU]
~z~you'll be locked up and calling some cellmate Daddy within a month. 
[INTRO_P2_5:INTROAU]
~z~Yes, sir.
[INTRO_P2_6:INTROAU]
~z~If I had it my way, we wouldn't waste our time - you'd be inside already. 
[INTRO_P2_7:INTROAU]
~z~Mr. Grey has made great progress. 
[INTRO_P2_8:INTROAU]
~z~His share on willfulness was one of the most powerful things I've ever heard. 
[INTRO_P2_9:INTROAU]
~z~I believe in this man.
[INTRO_P2_10:INTROAU]
~z~Well, let's hope you don't live to regret that faith.
[INTRO_P2_11:INTROAU]
~z~God works in mysterious ways.
[INTRO_P2_12:INTROAU]
~z~In this case, it seems God is down right perverse, 
[INTRO_P2_13:INTROAU]
~z~but I'll leave the salvation to you gentlemen. 
[INTRO_P2_14:INTROAU]
~z~You, stay out of trouble.
[INTRO_P2_15:INTROAU]
~z~Yes, Daddy. 
[INTRO_P2_16:INTROAU]
~z~Excuse me?
[INTRO_P2_17:INTROAU]
~z~Yes sir.
[INTRO_P2_18:INTROAU]
~z~Remember. It's a disease. 
[INTRO_P2_19:INTROAU]
~z~I know, Chad. I know. It's a disease. 
[INTRO_P2_20:INTROAU]
~z~Meetings every day. 
[INTRO_P2_21:INTROAU]
~z~Call you if I feel the need to use. 
[INTRO_P2_22:INTROAU]
~z~Pray. I pray. 
[INTRO_P2_23:INTROAU]
~z~In fact, I'm praying right now. 
[INTRO_P2_24:INTROAU]
~z~You're very willful.
[INTRO_P2_25:INTROAU]
~z~Was very willful, Chad, was very willful. 
[INTRO_P2_26:INTROAU]
~z~I've changed. And you know what, Chad? 
[INTRO_P2_27:INTROAU]
~z~You changed me. 
[INTRO_P2_28:INTROAU]
~z~Gentlemen, shall we get the fuck out of here? 
[INTRO_P2_29:INTROAU]
~z~Hey, stay in touch! 
[INTRO_P2_30:INTROAU]
~z~Yo.
[INTRO_P2_31:INTROAU]
~z~Here you go.
[INTRO_P2_32:INTROAU]
~z~It's about time.
[INTRO_P2_33:INTROAU]
~z~Home sweet home.


{Clean and Serene}

[E1B1_GO_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Come on, brothers. Get me back to church.
[E1B1_GO_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Let's get the fuck outta here. Back to the house, boys. 
[E1B1_GO_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Back to the source, boys. That bar had better be stocked.

[E1B1_B1V1_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Only Billy Grey would get taken down on a distribution beef and end up in a country club. 
[E1B1_B1V1_2:E1B1AUD]
~z~How were things in there? 
[E1B1_B1V1_4:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know, John boy, it was kinda hard. Harder than you'd think. 
[E1B1_B1V1_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~I don't know what I'd rather go back to, stints in the hole or group share cluster fucks in that place.
[E1B1_B1V1_7:E1B1AUD]
~z~Okay.
[E1B1_B1V1_9:E1B1AUD]
~z~Whether it's train gangs in the showers or grown men crying and hugging in rehab, 
[E1B1_B1V1_10:E1B1AUD]
~z~there's definitely an undeniable twinge of homosexuality in this fine country's correctional system. 
[E1B1_B1V1_11:E1B1AUD]
~z~No wonder you keep getting caught then, Billy. You can't stay away from it. 
[E1B1_B1V1_12:E1B1AUD]
~z~Now, let's be clear, I keep getting caught because assholes like you
[E1B1_B1V1_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~ain't watching out for me. 
[E1B1_B1V1_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~Don't question me. Sometimes you gotta look out for yourself, Billy.
[E1B1_B1V1_16:E1B1AUD]
~z~Okay. I'll save my questions until I see the chapter. And you better have looked after my baby.

[E1B1_GUANT_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~That guy with the bone yard might know where the bike is. He's over on Guantanamo.
[E1B1_GUANT_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Shit, I guess we gotta make a call on Pretty Boy. He's over in Bohan on Guantanamo. 
[E1B1_GUANT_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Let's hope Pretty Boy still knows where this thing is. Guantanamo Avenue, boys. 

[E1B1_RIDE_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Scooch up, Johnny boy. I'm riding bitch.
[E1B1_RIDE_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Until we get my bike. I'm the monkey on your back.
[E1B1_RIDE_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Brothers aren't meant to be this close, Johnny. But we're gonna have to be until I get my bike back. 

[E1B1_B2V1_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Look at me, manage to avoid prison and I'm still ass to cock with a dude. 
[E1B1_B2V1_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah, well, I ain't too happy about it neither man - you wanna turn around and go back to the clubhouse?
[E1B1_B2V1_4:E1B1AUD]
~z~I'm happy about it alright, John boy. Fuck, after that therapy shit, a drink and the road is all I need. 
[E1B1_B2V1_6:E1B1AUD]
~z~Good to know. 
[E1B1_B2V1_8:E1B1AUD]
~z~You been missing me all that time I spent sharing and caring in rehab?
[E1B1_B2V1_10:E1B1AUD]
~z~Let's get your bike and save the emotions for later.
[E1B1_B2V1_11:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know what, Johnny? You could do with some of the trust exercises they got in there. 
[E1B1_B2V1_12:E1B1AUD]
~z~I'm going to blindfold you when we get back. All you gotta do is fall over and trust that your brothers
[E1B1_B2V1_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~are going to catch ya. Can you do that?
[E1B1_B2V1_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~You boys'll be too drunk to catch VD, let alone two hundred and thirty pounds of rapidly approaching middle age. 
[E1B1_B2V1_17:E1B1AUD]
~z~Technically, you're two hundred and thirty pounds of Jewish biker, John boy.
[E1B1_B2V1_18:E1B1AUD]
~z~Your faith has gotta come first.
[E1B1_B2V1_20:E1B1AUD]
~z~Religion, Billy. Religion. I gave up with faith.
[E1B1_B2V1_22:E1B1AUD]
~z~Johnny the Jew. Klebitz the Heeb. Good to be here, man. Good to fucking be here. What's your problem?
[E1B1_B2V1_24:E1B1AUD]
~z~Nothing, man.
[E1B1_B2V1_26:E1B1AUD]
~z~I'm the leader of the chapter again, Johnny. And you're just another brother. Can you handle it?
[E1B1_B2V1_28:E1B1AUD]
~z~Long as you run the chapter right we can all handle it.
[E1B1_B2V1_30:E1B1AUD]
~z~I'll run it the way it needs to be run. Same as the three guys before me did. 
[E1B1_B2V1_32:E1B1AUD]
~z~Same as I'm doing now. 
[E1B1_B2V1_34:E1B1AUD]
~z~Really? It feels kinda different. 
[E1B1_B2V1_35:E1B1AUD]
~z~Before all we cared about was having fun, the brothers, getting shit-faced,
[E1B1_B2V1_36:E1B1AUD]
~z~it's screw you, you get in our way, you're gonna get your teeth kicked in.
[E1B1_B2V1_38:E1B1AUD]
~z~Thank you for sharing! And now what's it feel like to you, Jonathan?
[E1B1_B2V1_40:E1B1AUD]
~z~It feels like knocking heads is a full time job 
[E1B1_B2V1_41:E1B1AUD]
~z~and maybe if we stopped doing it for a minute, we'd look around and realize that the fun ended a long time ago.
[E1B1_B2V1_43:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah? Well, I signed up to be a brother for life, you ungrateful fuck. 
[E1B1_B2V1_45:E1B1AUD]
~z~If you're in The Lost for the good times only, fair weather weekends in the Carraways, then you ain't in The Lost. 
[E1B1_B2V1_47:E1B1AUD]
~z~You get me?
[E1B1_B2V1_49:E1B1AUD]
~z~Chill out, man. I just hope when we decide to take a break, to slow down, that it's still an option on the table.

[E1B1_FALL_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Forgotten how to ride while I was inside, did you?
[E1B1_FALL_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Shit, John. You should have a drink. Your nerves must be shot.
[E1B1_FALL_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~You ain't gonna keep those good looks if you keep falling off your bike, John. 
[E1B1_FALL_04:E1B1AUD]
~z~You trying to break my neck on my first day outside?
[E1B1_FALL_05:E1B1AUD]
~z~What the fuck, John boy - you hate me more than my parole officer does? 

[E1B1_OFF_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~What's the hold up?
[E1B1_OFF_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Where you going? 
[E1B1_OFF_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Come on, man. Don't throw a hissy fit. 
[E1B1_OFF_04:E1B1AUD]
~z~Get back on the bike, Johnny. It ain't an order....yet.
[E1B1_OFF_05:E1B1AUD]
~z~You off to Temple or something?

[E1B1_BOFF_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~I may be on the pussy pad, but I'm still chapter leader, man.
[E1B1_BOFF_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~You should be more careful of your leader, Johnny.
[E1B1_BOFF_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Good thing I'm not fragile, Johnny. Otherwise I'd break when you treat me like this. 

[E1B1_JSTOP_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~What's the hold up, man?
[E1B1_JSTOP_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Can you see something I can't? Why're we stopped?
[E1B1_JSTOP_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~I thought you were leading us there, Johnny.
[E1B1_JSTOP_04:E1B1AUD]
~z~Take us there, Johnny. Come on. 

[E1B1_ARR_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Here we are.
[E1B1_ARR_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~He should be in here.
[E1B1_ARR_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~This is the joint.

[E1B1_MOVE_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Alright then, let's wrap this up.
[E1B1_MOVE_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Okay, now all we gotta do is pick up the bike.
[E1B1_MOVE_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Come on, let's get this over with.

[E1B1_HANG_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~You didn't have to do that. He told you who had the bike.
[E1B1_HANG_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~You really gone soft, haven't you Johnny? You know, you could do with a stretch in the joint, might harden you up.
[E1B1_HANG_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~Whatever.
[E1B1_HANG_7:E1B1AUD]
~z~What about an eye for an eye and all that shit? 
[E1B1_HANG_8:E1B1AUD]
~z~You shoulda been the one to make that guy pay for holding out.
[E1B1_HANG_9:E1B1AUD]
~z~Enough with that shit. We got more things to worry about than respect and stupid kids' stuff. 
[E1B1_HANG_10:E1B1AUD]
~z~We got to keep business afloat or we're fucked.
[E1B1_HANG_12:E1B1AUD]
~z~You just don't get it, do you? This is what it's about. This. Not that money shit. 
[E1B1_HANG_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~We're in it to stick it to all those yuppies and hippies and mother fucking Deadbeats. 
[E1B1_HANG_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~Give me a stiff drink, some hard drugs, the road and my chopper. That's all I need. Maybe an occasional bit of the hole. 
[E1B1_HANG_17:E1B1AUD]
~z~Wouldn't be a man if I didn't need that now, would I? How's Ashley, by the way? She single?
[E1B1_HANG_19:E1B1AUD]
~z~What about your brothers, man? Ain't you in it for The Lost?
[E1B1_HANG_21:E1B1AUD]
~z~Everything I do is about The Lost. I don't exist without my brothers - without you. 
[E1B1_HANG_22:E1B1AUD]
~z~If you don't get that, then you don't get nothing, John boy. Sad state of affairs.
[E1B1_HANG_24:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah, well, it's some tough love you're showing them. 

[E1B1_THERE_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~We're here.
[E1B1_THERE_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~This is it, here goes.
[E1B1_THERE_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~I hope that bike's here, man.

[E1B1_ATTK_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~We're gonna go get my fucking ride.
[E1B1_ATTK_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Screw the fucking Angels of Death.
[E1B1_ATTK_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~We're here for our property, you Deadbeats.

[E1B1_BFIGHT_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~You Deadbeats are gonna pay.
[E1B1_BFIGHT_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Where's my baby?
[E1B1_BFIGHT_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Fuck the AOD.
[E1B1_BFIGHT_04:E1B1AUD]
~z~Where is it?
[E1B1_BFIGHT_05:E1B1AUD]
~z~You shouldn't take another man's bike.
[E1B1_BFIGHT_06:E1B1AUD]
~z~This'll teach you to screw with The Lost.

[E1B1_SHOOTB_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~That's my bike, Johnny. 
[E1B1_SHOOTB_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~You're going to fix that, John boy.
[E1B1_SHOOTB_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Watch the fucking bike, asshole.
[E1B1_SHOOTB_04:E1B1AUD]
~z~Fucking Johnny. Look where you're shooting.

[E1B1_JFIGHT_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Give up the bike, come on.
[E1B1_JFIGHT_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Make this easy on yourselves.
[E1B1_JFIGHT_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~We just want the bike.
[E1B1_JFIGHT_04:E1B1AUD]
~z~That bike is property of The Lost.
[E1B1_JFIGHT_05:E1B1AUD]
~z~Easy there.
[E1B1_JFIGHT_06:E1B1AUD]
~z~Get down and stay down.

[E1B1_AFIGHT_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~I thought we had a truce here?
[E1B1_AFIGHT_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~This bike's ours fair and square.
[E1B1_AFIGHT_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~What moron let Billy Grey outta the joint?
[E1B1_AFIGHT_04:E1B1AUD]
~z~Fuck me, Joe Jon's gonna be pissed.
[E1B1_AFIGHT_05:E1B1AUD]
~z~You're on AOD turf now, boys.
[E1B1_AFIGHT_06:E1B1AUD]
~z~The Lost ain't nobody. Fuck yuz.

[E1B1_DEAD_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~There she is, my baby.
[E1B1_DEAD_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~I have been missing this bitch.
[E1B1_DEAD_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Lives were lost today. Can't say it wasn't worth it though.

[E1B1_BACK_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Follow me back to the house, boys.
[E1B1_BACK_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~I think we earned us a drink, follow me.
[E1B1_BACK_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Back me up, brothers, we're heading for a drink.

[E1B1_B1V2_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Had any contact with my dear old friends, the Angels of Death?
[E1B1_B1V2_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~There's a truce, Billy. You know that. A truce means no hassle, 
[E1B1_B1V2_4:E1B1AUD]
~z~everybody gets to do business and make money without looking over their shoulders too much.
[E1B1_B1V2_6:E1B1AUD]
~z~All the money in the world isn't worth anything if you don't have your pride, my brother. 
[E1B1_B1V2_8:E1B1AUD]
~z~It's hard to be proud when you don't have a roof over your head. I can show you the books.
[E1B1_B1V2_10:E1B1AUD]
~z~Fucking books, man. Fucking books. Show me whiskey. Show me some hole.
[E1B1_B1V2_11:E1B1AUD]
~z~I've been putting up with rehab skanks getting sex therapy for the last few months. I need something real. 
[E1B1_B1V2_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~Oh yeah?
[E1B1_B1V2_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~Who's been hanging round the house? The usual mattress cover?
[E1B1_B1V2_17:E1B1AUD]
~z~Some old faces, some new ones.
[E1B1_B1V2_19:E1B1AUD]
~z~I ain't interested in their faces. You're the one who gets emotionally attached, J, not me.
[E1B1_B1V2_20:E1B1AUD]
~z~Well, not to women at least.
[E1B1_B1V2_22:E1B1AUD]
~z~Just bikes and drugs then?
[E1B1_B1V2_24:E1B1AUD]
~z~Bikes and brothers, Johnny. Bikes and brothers. 
[E1B1_B1V2_25:E1B1AUD]
~z~I ain't attached to no drugs, man. They're attached to me, clingy bastards.

[E1B1_B3V2_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Poor fuck. I don't think he's got any nose left.
[E1B1_B3V2_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Well yours is plenty big, my compassionate friend. You should donate some. To the cause.
[E1B1_B3V2_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~Shit, you know best, Bill, you're the leader. You make these decisions, 
[E1B1_B3V2_6:E1B1AUD]
~z~I'll just taxi you around on your little welcome back tour. 
[E1B1_B3V2_7:E1B1AUD]
~z~There any more side trips you want to make on the way to the Deadbeats?
[E1B1_B3V2_9:E1B1AUD]
~z~No, I just want my bike back, that's what this is all about.
[E1B1_B3V2_11:E1B1AUD]
~z~Good.
[E1B1_B3V2_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~But Johnny, you need to quit your bitching and moaning. 
[E1B1_B3V2_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~I'm not gonna quit telling you when you're being an asshole. 
[E1B1_B3V2_16:E1B1AUD]
~z~Being a leader doesn't make you right.
[E1B1_B3V2_18:E1B1AUD]
~z~You haven't always got the information, brother. So shut up and behave.
[E1B1_B3V2_19:E1B1AUD]
~z~Your ego is getting you into trouble, my friend.
[E1B1_B3V2_21:E1B1AUD]
~z~It used to be all you need to worry about was waking up with was some bruises. 
[E1B1_B3V2_22:E1B1AUD]
~z~Maybe a broken rib and a hangover. 
[E1B1_B3V2_24:E1B1AUD]
~z~Don't forget about the ugly broads you'd take home.
[E1B1_B3V2_26:E1B1AUD]
~z~Now, Pretty Boy's waking up without a face. 
[E1B1_B3V2_27:E1B1AUD]
~z~That's not gonna go back to normal. Angus lost his legs for life.
[E1B1_B3V2_29:E1B1AUD]
~z~You're out of line, Johnny. You're out of line. 

[E1B1_JFRONT_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Stay in formation, Johnny. Get behind me.
[E1B1_JFRONT_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~You forgotten your place, soldier? Stay behind the ride captain.
[E1B1_JFRONT_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~You're outta line, John boy. Stick behind me.

[E1B1_BK1V1_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Hey, Billy! How's it feel to be on the old bike, man?
[E1B1_BK1V1_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Like when your wife is screwing the neighbor. I'm gonna be up all night tuning her back to normal. 
[E1B1_BK1V1_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~You're gonna be up all night fucking and getting high. The bike'll wait til morning.

[E1B1_BK1V2_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~You like being back in line? Wouldn't want you getting too used to thinking for yourself. 
[E1B1_BK1V2_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah, Bill? At least I twisted the wick when I had the brothers behind me, old man.
[E1B1_BK1V2_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~I'll twist your wick, Johnny. Twist the little thing right off your body.

[E1B1_J1V1_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Billy got his bike back. He'll be cool now.
[E1B1_J1V1_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah, Jim? Something tells me fucking up Pretty Boy and killing them Deadbeats ain't enough for him. 
[E1B1_J1V1_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~Maybe. Let's just say I'm not gonna share today's events with Jackie and the kid.

[E1B1_T1V1_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~What's Ashley gonna do now Billy's back?
[E1B1_T1V1_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Fuck me Terry. That's her call. It's a free country.
[E1B1_T1V1_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~I don't know where you've been living, pal. Us brothers are the only free people I see.

[E1B1_JA1V1_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Jason, I haven't see you around much, man.
[E1B1_JA1V1_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah, I been fucking this Russian broad in Broker. Gets her psycho daddy real mad.
[E1B1_JA1V1_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~He gives you trouble, he'll have to start worrying about the whole chapter.
[E1B1_JA1V1_6:E1B1AUD]
~z~Tell him that. Then we'll see how psycho he is.

[E1B1_BNT1V2_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~How's Angus?
[E1B1_BNT1V2_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Good, you know. You should go and see him.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah, sure. I got a lot on my plate. I only just got out and look at the state of shit around here. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_7:E1B1AUD]
~z~He'd appreciate it if you made some time for him. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_9:E1B1AUD]
~z~He may be stuck in a chair, but he's still a member of The Lost. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_11:E1B1AUD]
~z~That guy, he's an exceptional human being, an example to us all. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~After the accident, shit. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_16:E1B1AUD]
~z~I mean, he can't ride, he can't get any hole. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_18:E1B1AUD]
~z~I know what he can't do, Billy. He does too. Just go and fucking see him, alright?
[E1B1_BNT1V2_20:E1B1AUD]
~z~You're tense, Johnny. Must have been stressful heading up the chapter while I was away. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_22:E1B1AUD]
~z~It was fine.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_24:E1B1AUD]
~z~Not everybody's shoulders are wide enough to bear the responsibility. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_26:E1B1AUD]
~z~Are any of the brothers giving you shit? I'll have a talk to them, don't worry.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_28:E1B1AUD]
~z~Things ran smoothly, Bill. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_30:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know, they ran real smooth when we were concentrating on shifting drugs 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_31:E1B1AUD]
~z~and not just putting them in our arms or up our noses.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_33:E1B1AUD]
~z~With a nose the size of yours there wouldn't be much blow left for the other brothers anyway, John boy.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_35:E1B1AUD]
~z~All I'm saying is we were cool. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_37:E1B1AUD]
~z~We took a break from saying "fuck you" to everything and we made some deals that worked out.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_39:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah, good for you Johnny. If you had so much fun why don't you go start your own chapter? 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_41:E1B1AUD]
~z~That's not what I meant, man.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_42:E1B1AUD]
~z~Because this one, my chapter, isn't big enough to have two people pulling it in different directions.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_44:E1B1AUD]
~z~I know, man. I'm loyal, but I ain't a drone, man. We should be able to talk about shit.
[E1B1_BNT1V2_46:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know, I've been here since I got out of juvie. 
[E1B1_BNT1V2_48:E1B1AUD]
~z~I've seen men die for their brothers and men rat their brothers out. And I know that this gang don't mean shit
[E1B1_BNT1V2_49:E1B1AUD]
~z~if men don't follow their leader.

[E1B1_KNOCK_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Easy, John.
[E1B1_KNOCK_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Whoa, Johnny.
[E1B1_KNOCK_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Losing your edge, man.
[E1B1_KNOCK_04:E1B1AUD]
~z~Watch it.
[E1B1_KNOCK_05:E1B1AUD]
~z~Come on, man.

[E1B1_OUT_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~If you want something done right, you do it yourself. 
[E1B1_OUT_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Brothers, I couldn't let you run this errand without me. You might fuck it up.
[E1B1_OUT_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~Hold on. I'm thinking you could use the guiding hand of your president on this noble quest.

[E1B1_AHEAD_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Why don't you ride with the brothers, Johnny? Being acting President must have changed you.
[E1B1_AHEAD_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Ride with the brothers, man. Did you get too good for them while I was away?
[E1B1_AHEAD_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~The Lost MC rides together, Johnny. That change while I was in there?

[E1B1_C1V1_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Looks like Billy's back getting this old gang into deep shit. 
[E1B1_C1V1_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~That's a President's job, ain't it, Clay? Same with a motorcycle club or a whole country.
[E1B1_C1V1_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~Who knows, man? I leave the politicking to you boys.

[E1B1_LEAD_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Okay, Johnny boy. I hope you had fun playing leader, but the big man is back. Stay behind me.
[E1B1_LEAD_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~You've had your turn at the head of this pack, but I'm here now. So you better do what I say, Johnny.

[BG01_CA_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Pretty Boy. 
[BG01_CA_2:E1B1AUD]
~z~Hey.
[BG01_CA_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~Where's the bike? 
[BG01_CA_4:E1B1AUD]
~z~Oh, it's good to see you too, tough guys. 
[BG01_CA_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~Uhh... what bike are you talking about exactly?
[BG01_CA_6:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know what we're talking about. Billy's bike. 
[BG01_CA_7:E1B1AUD]
~z~Billy's bike? Jesus, man, it's been a long time. 
[BG01_CA_8:E1B1AUD]
~z~I thought he was dead. What's he want it for? 
[BG01_CA_9:E1B1AUD]
~z~To sell it for crack right, eh? 
[BG01_CA_10:E1B1AUD]
~z~Shut up.
[BG01_CA_11:E1B1AUD]
~z~Listen, you know how it is. 
[BG01_CA_12:E1B1AUD]
~z~Thing's passed hands, parts been changed up. 
[BG01_CA_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~Hard to say if that chopper's even around anymore. 
[BG01_CA_14:E1B1AUD]
~z~Sorry, boys.
[BG01_CA_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~You will be, my friend. You will be. 
[BG01_CA_16:E1B1AUD]
~z~Hey, good to see you, Bill. 
[BG01_CA_17:E1B1AUD]
~z~Man, I thought you was dead...
[BG01_CA_18:E1B1AUD]
~z~Jim start up the bike.
[BG01_CA_19:E1B1AUD]
~z~Whoa, hold on...
[BG01_CA_20:E1B1AUD]
~z~Wait please, please...no, noooo...
[BG01_CA_21:E1B1AUD]
~z~Where - is - my bike? 
[BG01_CA_22:E1B1AUD]
~z~Speak, you ugly fuck. 
[BG01_CA_23:E1B1AUD]
~z~Ah, okay listen... 
[BG01_CA_24:E1B1AUD]
~z~ah, the Angels of Death took it to their place in Northwood. 
[BG01_CA_25:E1B1AUD]
~z~- Motherfucking Angels of Death.~n~- That's all I know... please!
[BG01_CA_26:E1B1AUD]
~z~Thank you.
[BG01_CA_27:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yes, thank you. 

[BG01_CB_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~Okay, Bill. You got your bike. 
[BG01_CB_2:E1B1AUD]
~z~Take what you gotta take, 
[BG01_CB_3:E1B1AUD]
~z~drink what you gotta drink, fuck what you gotta fuck. 
[BG01_CB_4:E1B1AUD]
~z~I don't care, kill who you gotta kill. 
[BG01_CB_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~But get it out of your system.
[BG01_CB_6:E1B1AUD]
~z~Mmm.
[BG01_CB_7:E1B1AUD]
~z~And when you do, give me a call and we'll get back to business.
[BG01_CB_8:E1B1AUD]
~z~You're not my PO, brother. 
[BG01_CB_9:E1B1AUD]
~z~Remember who the head of this chapter is.
[BG01_CB_10:E1B1AUD]
~z~I do, man... trust me.
[BG01_CB_11:E1B1AUD]
~z~Tell me, do you still have Ashley's phone number? 
[BG01_CB_12:E1B1AUD]
~z~Why don't you give her a call for me? 
[BG01_CB_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~Tell her I'm inside, getting all sorts of fucked up.
[BG01_CB_14:E1B1AUD]
~z~And that I would really like some,
[BG01_CB_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~I mean we, meaning all of us, would love some hole. 

[BG01_BACK_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Welcome back, man.
[BG01_BACK_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Here we are, dude.
[BG01_BACK_03:E1B1AUD]

[BG01_TALK_05:E1B1AUD]
~z~Okay.

[E1B1_FALL2_01:E1B1AUD]
~z~Forgotten how to ride while I was in rehab, did you?
[E1B1_FALL2_02:E1B1AUD]
~z~Shit, Johnny. You should have a drink. Your nerves must be shot.
[E1B1_FALL2_03:E1B1AUD]
~z~You ain't gonna keep those good looks if you keep falling off your bike, John. 

[INTRO_P3_1:E1B1AUD]
~z~It is good to be back my brothers!
[INTRO_P3_2:E1B1AUD]

[INTRO_P3_5:E1B1AUD]
~z~We missed you, Bill. 
[INTRO_P3_6:E1B1AUD]
~z~So, aching for a fucking drink here.
[INTRO_P3_7:E1B1AUD]

[INTRO_P3_9:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yummy. So, Johnny boy. Where's my bike?
[INTRO_P3_10:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know where it is. 
[INTRO_P3_11:E1B1AUD]
~z~Let me rephrase the question - 
[INTRO_P3_12:E1B1AUD]
~z~where the fuck is my bike, 
[INTRO_P3_13:E1B1AUD]
~z~and why the fuck haven't you got it back for me? 
[INTRO_P3_14:E1B1AUD]
~z~Because you know where it is. 
[INTRO_P3_15:E1B1AUD]
~z~Are you deaf? Give me that whisky. 
[INTRO_P3_16:E1B1AUD]
~z~Are you fucking deaf?
[INTRO_P3_17:E1B1AUD]
~z~No.
[INTRO_P3_18:E1B1AUD]
~z~Then answer the God damn question. 
[INTRO_P3_19:E1B1AUD]
~z~Why the fuck haven't you got it back for me, friend, brother?
[INTRO_P3_20:E1B1AUD]
~z~One word: business. 
[INTRO_P3_21:E1B1AUD]
~z~Like I told you when you were in there, 
[INTRO_P3_22:E1B1AUD]
~z~or were you so busy playing holier-than-thou 
[INTRO_P3_23:E1B1AUD]
~z~you started believing your own bullshit?
[INTRO_P3_24:E1B1AUD]
~z~Oh forgive me. 
[INTRO_P3_25:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know, I've had a complicated few weeks. 
[INTRO_P3_26:E1B1AUD]
~z~I can only imagine, Bill.
[INTRO_P3_27:E1B1AUD]
~z~Shut up Brian. 
[INTRO_P3_28:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know, coming off heroin's kinda hard. 
[INTRO_P3_29:E1B1AUD]
~z~I think I acquired this touch of amnesia. 
[INTRO_P3_30:E1B1AUD]
~z~What business is more important, 
[INTRO_P3_31:E1B1AUD]
~z~mister 1980s yuppie big shot, 
[INTRO_P3_32:E1B1AUD]
~z~than your best friend's bike, 
[INTRO_P3_33:E1B1AUD]
~z~when he's close to getting a fifteen year stretch? 
[INTRO_P3_34:E1B1AUD]
~z~The business that pays his lawyers fees. 
[INTRO_P3_35:E1B1AUD]
~z~The business that puts food on all of our tables. 
[INTRO_P3_36:E1B1AUD]
~z~The business that we are all in, while you're out pretending to be saved.
[INTRO_P3_37:E1B1AUD]
~z~Get my bike.
[INTRO_P3_38:E1B1AUD]
~z~What am I? 
[INTRO_P3_39:E1B1AUD]
~z~Your fucking dog? 
[INTRO_P3_40:E1B1AUD]
~z~I told you we should have got the bike.
[INTRO_P3_41:E1B1AUD]
~z~You told me?
[INTRO_P3_42:E1B1AUD]
~z~You told me? You don't tell me shit, you little fuck. 
[INTRO_P3_43:E1B1AUD]
~z~Listen, Billy, they were pissed and they had a reason. 
[INTRO_P3_44:E1B1AUD]
~z~Your bike chopped that girl's leg off. 
[INTRO_P3_45:E1B1AUD]
~z~You put Joe Jon's nephew in a coma. 
[INTRO_P3_46:E1B1AUD]
~z~The Deadbeats kept the bike. We needed the money.
[INTRO_P3_47:E1B1AUD]
~z~You needed some balls. 
[INTRO_P3_48:E1B1AUD]
~z~Some fuckin' heart. Something. 
[INTRO_P3_49:E1B1AUD]
~z~I can't believe I'm hearing this shit.
[INTRO_P3_50:E1B1AUD]
~z~Yeah. 
[INTRO_P3_51:E1B1AUD]
~z~And I can't believe I'm hearing this - 
[INTRO_P3_52:E1B1AUD]
~z~after everything we did for you.

~z~Paid your rehab, paid your lawyers fees, 
[INTRO_P3_54:E1B1AUD]
~z~paid your rent, paid everything, shit, we set stuff up for you. 
[INTRO_P3_55:E1B1AUD]

[INTRO_P3_56:E1B1AUD]
~z~You're right, you're right, no, you're right... 
[INTRO_P3_57:E1B1AUD]
~z~You know what I'm going to do?
[INTRO_P3_58:E1B1AUD]
~z~ I'm gonna run right out and buy a condo. 
[INTRO_P3_59:E1B1AUD]

[INTRO_P3_73:E1B1AUD]
~z~It was really frustrating. Fucked up shit. 
[INTRO_P3_74:E1B1AUD]
~z~Craziness, right? 
[INTRO_P3_75:E1B1AUD]
~z~Okay so I'm a little pissed off and I've been a bit of a prick lately, 
[INTRO_P3_76:E1B1AUD]

~z~We got Deadbeats to screw up. Come on.

[E1B3_BL1V1_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~See Johnny? I told you this truce meant nothing.
[E1B3_BL1V1_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~You're the one who wiped his ass on the truce to start with.
[E1B3_BL1V1_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Pre-emptive strike, my brother. And fuck me if it wasn't the right move.

[E1B3_BL1V2_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~You like Mr. David Grossman then Johnny? 
[E1B3_BL1V2_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~He's got some business contacts that'll appeal to your newly minted business mind.
[E1B3_BL1V2_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~You talk and talk about sticking it to the man and then you hang out with a lawyer? 
[E1B3_BL1V2_7:E1B3AUD]
~z~You must be an American, man - you understand hypocrisy so damn well. 
[E1B3_BL1V2_9:E1B3AUD]
~z~I'm a complicated individual and I've got serious authority issues.
[E1B3_BL1V2_11:E1B3AUD]
~z~Ask my councilor. 

[E1B3_BR1V3_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~So are you gonna fight alongside your brothers or are you going to join the Deadbeats?
[E1B3_BR1V3_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~As much as I'd like to kick your ass, Brian. I could never go against a brother.
[E1B3_BR1V3_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Yeah, not to his face at least. I bet you'd stab him in the back though.

[E1B3_BR1V2_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Brian, Brian, are you sure you want to be here? I mean this is a man's job after all.
[E1B3_BR1V2_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~No, Johnny, nope. You're the fucking pussy, man. 
[E1B3_BR1V2_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Shit, I can't hear you, big man. It's the wind. Speak up next time.

[E1B3_LAGS_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~We're only as fast as the slowest brother. 
[E1B3_LAGS_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~Something wrong with your bike, Johnny?
[E1B3_LAGS_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Shit Johnny, the speed you're going you'd think you didn't want to save the brothers.
[E1B3_LAGS_04:E1B3AUD]
~z~The brothers are getting jumped, come on bitch.
[E1B3_LAGS_05:E1B3AUD]
~z~Hey, lady, you forget how to twist the throttle?

[E1B3_ARRV_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~You Deadbeats think you can fuck with The Lost?
[E1B3_ARRV_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~We don't take shit from Deadbeats. 
[E1B3_ARRV_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Let's do this!

[E1B3_FIGHT1_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Fucking Deadbeats. 
[E1B3_FIGHT1_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~The truce is over, brothers.
[E1B3_FIGHT1_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~It's war, people.
[E1B3_FIGHT1_04:E1B3AUD]
~z~The Deadbeats are dying. 
[E1B3_FIGHT1_05:E1B3AUD]
~z~You really are angels now. 
[E1B3_FIGHT1_06:E1B3AUD]
~z~Now you're a proper deadbeat.

[E1B3_MORE_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Fresh meat!
[E1B3_MORE_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~Like lambs to the slaughter. 
[E1B3_MORE_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~More Deadbeats to play with, brothers.

[E1B3_FIGHT2_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Heh, heh, Deadbeats. 
[E1B3_FIGHT2_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~They're really scared of you, Billy. 
[E1B3_FIGHT2_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Billy Grey is back, Deadbeats. 
[E1B3_FIGHT2_04:E1B3AUD]
~z~Heh, heh, heh. 
[E1B3_FIGHT2_05:E1B3AUD]
~z~Yeah, yeah, come on. 
[E1B3_FIGHT2_06:E1B3AUD]
~z~Deadbeats, Deadbeats, Deadbeats. 

[E1B3_MORE2_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Watch out, Billy. More of them. 
[E1B3_MORE2_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~More Deadbeats to fuck up, Billy. 
[E1B3_MORE2_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Uhh, there's more Deadbeats here. 
[E1B3_MORE2_04:E1B3AUD]
~z~Billy, Billy, did you see these guys? 

[E1B3_BLOW_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Fuck, man.

~z~Quite a show.
[E1B3_BLOW_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Shit, man.
[E1B3_BLOW_04:E1B3AUD]
~z~Is everyone alright?
[E1B3_BLOW_05:E1B3AUD]
~z~The pigs are gonna hear this.

[E1B3_DEAD_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Saddle up, brothers. These fucks are dead.
[E1B3_DEAD_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~More Deadbeats on the funeral pyre. Get on your choppers.
[E1B3_DEAD_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Come on, brothers, get on your bikes. These Deadbeats have been taught a valuable lesson about respect.

[E1B3_NEXT_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~There's another ruckus going on. Hope you brothers are in the shit kickin' mood.
[E1B3_NEXT_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~Word is there's another skirmish. Come on.
[E1B3_NEXT_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~You ready to break some more heads? I heard some bitches are getting smart.

[E1B3_BL2V1_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Now, you can't tell me this don't give you a kick, brother.
[E1B3_BL2V1_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Time was we'd kick ass with baseball bats, not SMGs. Now that was fun.
[E1B3_BL2V1_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Things have grown up, brother. You want to survive, you got to grow up too.
[E1B3_BL2V1_7:E1B3AUD]
~z~Expand your horizons. Life is war, man.

[E1B3_BL2V2_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~It's all out war now, Johnny. Just like the old days.
[E1B3_BL2V2_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~The days when we had all the pigs this side of the West River coming down on us? Those happy days?
[E1B3_BL2V2_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~It doesn't matter if every bastard in the world is standing against you as long as you're with your brothers. 
[E1B3_BL2V2_7:E1B3AUD]
~z~I hope you can grow a heart one of these days

[E1B3_BR2V1_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Bill did good back there, you could learn a lot from watching him in a fight.
[E1B3_BR2V1_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Yeah, I need to do some learning. Mind if I practice on you, Brian? 
[E1B3_BR2V1_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Wouldn't want to hurt you. I don't hit women.

[E1B3_BR2V2_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Man, the Deadbeats seem real annoyed. If I was you, I'd be scared they'd attack me in the street. 
[E1B3_BR2V2_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~They're not going to mess with me while I'm with Bill. Ha ha. No one fucks with Bill.
[E1B3_BR2V2_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Good thing you're glued to him then.

[E1B3_ARRF_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~This is gonna to be fun.
[E1B3_ARRF_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~These Deadbeats just don't learn.
[E1B3_ARRF_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Let's take some scalps, boys.

[E1B3_AFTER_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Come here, people.
[E1B3_AFTER_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~Get in here, boys.

[E1B3_BDIES_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Billy, man. So long brother.

[E1B3_DROPBR_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Billy, you fucking killed him, Johnny. You let him die.
[E1B3_DROPBR_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Billy knew what he was getting himself into. 
[E1B3_DROPBR_4:E1B3AUD]
~z~He was a man, Brian - unlike you. Now get the fuck out of here.

[E1B3_BRDIES_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Shit. Brian's gone and fucking bought it.

[E1B3_DROP1_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~You should have been watching Brian, Johnny. This one's on you.
[E1B3_DROP1_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Yeah? I thought the responsibility might be yours, what with your being leader and all. Later on, brother.

[E1B3_BIKEB_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~We have got a problem, gentlemen.

[E1B3_DROP2_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Tell me, brother. How am I supposed to lead this motley crew of bikers, without a bike?
[E1B3_DROP2_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Answering a question like that's above my pay grade, man. 
[E1B3_DROP2_4:E1B3AUD]
~z~Why don't you come up with an answer and earn those stripes, Billy?

[E1B3_BIKEBR_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~My bike! My bike! Shit, guys.

[E1B3_DROP3_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Thanks for the ride, Klebitz-o-witz.
[E1B3_DROP3_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Thanks for fucking this whole thing up over a little engine trouble, Brian. 
[E1B3_DROP3_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Now get the hell out of my face. 

[E1B3_BIKEJ_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Oh man. You're kidding me.

[E1B3_DROP4_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Thanks for the ride, Billy.
[E1B3_DROP4_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~I'm not too big a man to wipe a brother's ass when he shits himself, Johnny. 
[E1B3_DROP4_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Just don't make a habit of it. 

[E1B3_DUMP_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Where'd I leave that thing?

[E1B3_DROP5_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~You start leaving bikes behind, you'll start leaving brothers behind. 
[E1B3_DROP5_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Sure, that makes a whole lotta sense. Thanks for the ride, Bill. 

[E1B3_CHAT_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Take them Deadbeats out, Billy
[E1B3_CHAT_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Shut up, Brian.

[E1B3_CHAT2_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Johnny. Johnny. Give me a shout if you need any help there.
[E1B3_CHAT2_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Don't need help from you, Brian.

[E1B3_CHAT3_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~War's back on, Deadbeats. Lost MC forever!
[E1B3_CHAT3_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Lost MC! Lost MC!

[E1B3_CHAT4_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~God forgives. The Lost don't.
[E1B3_CHAT4_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~We don't forgive. We don't. We don't.

[E1B3_CHAT5_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Maybe you should just stay in the clubhouse, Brian. You ain't much help out here with the big boys.
[E1B3_CHAT5_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Big boys. Heh heh heh. You're a homo, Johnny.

[E1B3_COME_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~We're moving out, Johnny. Let's go.
[E1B3_COME_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~No time for ass scratching, Johnny. Come on.
[E1B3_COME_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Time to move out, Johnny. Come on.

[BG03_AA_2:E1B3AUD]
~z~Were mad, Dave. Were. Not was. 
[BG03_AA_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~You should know that. 
[BG03_AA_4:E1B3AUD]
~z~No, you'd a been okay, because you are a...
[BG03_AA_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Because I am a lawyer. 
[BG03_AA_6:E1B3AUD]
~z~Yes. And during the week, you cover up those nice, gnarly tattoos
[BG03_AA_7:E1B3AUD]
~z~with a grey flannel suit and make a nice, steady income. 
[BG03_AA_8:E1B3AUD]
~z~Oh man, Tom Stubbs would love hanging out with you boys. 
[BG03_AA_9:E1B3AUD]
~z~He may be a politician, 
[BG03_AA_10:E1B3AUD]
~z~he may be a politician, but he ain't no square.
[BG03_AA_11:E1B3AUD]
~z~Smoke, Dave?
[BG03_AA_12:E1B3AUD]
~z~Oh, hell yes.
[BG03_AA_13:E1B3AUD]
~z~I put some mescaline in with the weed, Dave,
[BG03_AA_14:E1B3AUD]
~z~so I'd be very careful if I were you. 
[BG03_AA_15:E1B3AUD]
~z~You could be tripping for days. 
[BG03_AA_16:E1B3AUD]
~z~I can handle it.
[BG03_AA_17:E1B3AUD]
~z~Oh yeah, I fucking love you, man.

[BG03_AA_22:E1B3AUD]
~z~battling the very corporate forces he represents - 
[BG03_AA_23:E1B3AUD]
~z~say, Dave, are you a bi-sexual?
[BG03_AA_24:E1B3AUD]
~z~Very funny. 
[BG03_AA_25:E1B3AUD]
~z~I didn't think so, I guessed you just liked cock. 
[BG03_AA_26:E1B3AUD]
~z~Jonathon - bong hit?
[BG03_AA_27:E1B3AUD]
~z~No. 
[BG03_AA_28:E1B3AUD]
~z~Hey Dave, forgive me, man - 
[BG03_AA_29:E1B3AUD]

[BG03_AA_33:E1B3AUD]
~z~A documentary team in here? 
[BG03_AA_34:E1B3AUD]
~z~You going to write your autobiography or something? 
[BG03_AA_35:E1B3AUD]
~z~He's cool - he's a lawyer - he can help us with shit. 
[BG03_AA_36:E1B3AUD]
~z~He looks like an asshole.
[BG03_AA_37:E1B3AUD]
~z~And right now I think he's tripping his face off...
[BG03_AA_38:E1B3AUD]
~z~Whatever.
[BG03_AA_39:E1B3AUD]
~z~Look dude, you and me, shit seems kind of tense lately, doesn't it? 
[BG03_AA_40:E1B3AUD]
~z~It's kind of lame. Have I offended you in some way?
[BG03_AA_41:E1B3AUD]
~z~No.
[BG03_AA_42:E1B3AUD]
~z~Then what do you say we put all this shit behind us? 
[BG03_AA_43:E1B3AUD]
~z~And have some fun? 
[BG03_AA_44:E1B3AUD]
~z~Because life is pain, brother. 
[BG03_AA_45:E1B3AUD]
~z~And through this life, through this brotherhood, 
[BG03_AA_46:E1B3AUD]
~z~we can give the pain the finger.
[BG03_AA_47:E1B3AUD]
~z~Yeah fuck the pain!
[BG03_AA_48:E1B3AUD]
~z~Yeah, yeah, you're right man. Fuck it.
[BG03_AA_49:E1B3AUD]
~z~Yeah, yeah, are you fucking kidding me? Where? 
[BG03_AA_50:E1B3AUD]
~z~Alright all of you, let's go! Let's go. 
[BG03_AA_51:E1B3AUD]
~z~Our boys are getting jumped.

[BG03_ZA_1:E1B3AUD]
~z~Brothers...
[BG03_ZA_2:E1B3AUD]
~z~Brothers, come on in, gather round. 
[BG03_ZA_3:E1B3AUD]
~z~Hey...
[BG03_ZA_4:E1B3AUD]
~z~Chill out.
[BG03_ZA_5:E1B3AUD]
~z~Brothers,
[BG03_ZA_6:E1B3AUD]
~z~I just got word that Jason's been killed up in Broker. 
[BG03_ZA_7:E1B3AUD]
~z~Aw, man.
[BG03_ZA_8:E1B3AUD]
~z~He was banging some Russian broad 
[BG03_ZA_9:E1B3AUD]
~z~and her heavy duty father didn't much like it. 
[BG03_ZA_10:E1B3AUD]
~z~He hired a fucking Polack to do it. 
[BG03_ZA_11:E1B3AUD]
~z~I think he was a Serb, Brian. 
[BG03_ZA_12:E1B3AUD]
~z~Fucking Slav scumbag all the fucking same. 
[BG03_ZA_13:E1B3AUD]
~z~Shut the fuck up. 
[BG03_ZA_14:E1B3AUD]
~z~Brothers, we will find a way to get payback against this 
[BG03_ZA_15:E1B3AUD]
~z~Polish/ Russian/ Serb - I don't really give a shit.
[BG03_ZA_16:E1B3AUD]
~z~In the meantime, let's take a moment to remember Jason 
[BG03_ZA_17:E1B3AUD]
~z~and all the other men who've given the finger 
[BG03_ZA_18:E1B3AUD]
~z~to this shitty little thing that we call conformity. 
[BG03_ZA_19:E1B3AUD]
~z~Amen, Billy.
[BG03_ZA_20:E1B3AUD]
~z~Got that right.
[BG03_ZA_21:E1B3AUD]
~z~Now Jason was, he was just a kid, 
[BG03_ZA_22:E1B3AUD]
~z~but he hit the throttle harder than most of us, huh? 
[BG03_ZA_23:E1B3AUD]
~z~He was a law breaker, 
[BG03_ZA_24:E1B3AUD]
~z~trouble maker, 
[BG03_ZA_25:E1B3AUD]
~z~a beer drinker and hell-raiser. 
[BG03_ZA_26:E1B3AUD]
~z~He didn't suffer fools, 
[BG03_ZA_27:E1B3AUD]
~z~he got any piece of hole he wanted, 
[BG03_ZA_28:E1B3AUD]
~z~he always had time for a brother in need, 
[BG03_ZA_29:E1B3AUD]
~z~and he was scared of precisely jack shit. 
[BG03_ZA_30:E1B3AUD]
~z~That's right.
[BG03_ZA_31:E1B3AUD]
~z~In short - the kinda of man I'd want to be. 
[BG03_ZA_32:E1B3AUD]
~z~Jason Michaels - lost but not forgotten. 
[BG03_ZA_33:E1B3AUD]
~z~Amen to that, Billy.
[BG03_ZA_34:E1B3AUD]
~z~Jason.
[BG03_ZA_35:E1B3AUD]
~z~To Jason.
[BG03_ZA_36:E1B3AUD]
~z~Okay boys, the time for pussy licking and ass kissing is over. 
[BG03_ZA_37:E1B3AUD]
~z~We are brothers for life. 
[BG03_ZA_38:E1B3AUD]
~z~Lost forever.
[BG03_ZA_39:E1B3AUD]
~z~In these perilous times it's more important than ever 
[BG03_ZA_40:E1B3AUD]
~z~that you follow your leader. 
[BG03_ZA_41:E1B3AUD]
~z~And that is me, remember. 
[BG03_ZA_42:E1B3AUD]
~z~See you boys back at the clubhouse.

[E1B3_JFRONT_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Stay in formation, Johnny. Get behind me.
[E1B3_JFRONT_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~You forgotten your place, soldier? Stay behind the ride captain.
[E1B3_JFRONT_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~You're outta line, John boy. Stick behind me.

[E1B3_SEEYA_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~Ride safe, brothers. We'll see you at the house.
[E1B3_SEEYA_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~See you back, brothers. Keep safe.
[E1B3_SEEYA_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Wish us luck, my brothers. We'll see you back.

[E1B3_GRP1_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~You tried to jump our brothers? You're gonna pay for it.
[E1B3_GRP1_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~You shouldn't fuck with The Lost MC.
[E1B3_GRP1_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Fuck off, A.O.D. shitheads.
[E1B3_GRP1_04:E1B3AUD]
~z~You're on the wrong side of the West River, pricks.
[E1B3_GRP1_05:E1B3AUD]
~z~This is Lost turf, assholes.
[E1B3_GRP1_06:E1B3AUD]
~z~I am gonna punish you.

[E1B3_GRP2_01:E1B3AUD]
~z~What you guys up to here?
[E1B3_GRP2_02:E1B3AUD]
~z~We spoil your party, pricks?
[E1B3_GRP2_03:E1B3AUD]
~z~Some of your boys jumped my brothers.
[E1B3_GRP2_04:E1B3AUD]
~z~You racist pricks make me gag.
[E1B3_GRP2_05:E1B3AUD]
~z~Take it like a man, dude.
[E1B3_GRP2_06:E1B3AUD]
~z~This one's for my brothers.


{Action/ Reaction}

[E1B4_FOLLOW_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~I'm front door on this run, boys.
[E1B4_FOLLOW_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Get in formation, brothers.
[E1B4_FOLLOW_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Follow the leader, assholes.

[E1B4_BL1V1_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Still lifting weights, Billy?
[E1B4_BL1V1_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~I don't need to now that I'm carrying your heavy ass around with me, Johnny.
[E1B4_BL1V1_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~I think you got me confused with Brian. He's the one who's permanently suckered onto your ass.

[E1B4_BL1V2_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~So is this about kicking ass and feeling like big men or are we gonna make some money?
[E1B4_BL1V2_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~The two of them are not always mutually exclusive, my brother.
[E1B4_BL1V2_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~Really? Let's see.

[E1B4_BR1V1_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Don't you ever get tired of following Billy without knowing what's going on?
[E1B4_BR1V1_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~That's what you do with a leader, dumbass. Are you sad no one's following you, Johnny?
[E1B4_BR1V1_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~I'd be nothing but embarrassed to have you kissing my ass all day, Brian.

[E1B4_BR1V2_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Brian, man, you ever done time?
[E1B4_BR1V2_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Only people who do time are the ones that are dumb enough to get caught. Apart from Bill. He got unlucky.
[E1B4_BR1V2_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~It's not luck, Brian. The man wants you he's gonna come find you no matter how smart you think you are.

[E1B4_ARR_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Pull up, brothers.
[E1B4_ARR_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~We're here.
[E1B4_ARR_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Drop anchor, men.

[E1B4_ARR2_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Pay 'em back for Jason, man.
[E1B4_ARR2_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Shock and awe these Deadbeats.
[E1B4_ARR2_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Wake these Deadbeats up with a bang, brother.

[E1B4_GREET_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Looks like you got 'em angry, John boy.
[E1B4_GREET_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Dig some graves, boys. We're about to have some bodies on our hands.
[E1B4_GREET_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Did we wake you up, Deadbeats?

[E1B4_TAUNT_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~You shouldn't a killed our brother, Deadbeats.
[E1B4_TAUNT_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~This is for Jason.
[E1B4_TAUNT_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~You got something we want, Deadbeats.
[E1B4_TAUNT_04:E1B4AUD]
~z~Hey asshole, you'd be a lot less ugly with a bullet hole in your face.
[E1B4_TAUNT_05:E1B4AUD]
~z~Eat shit and die, Deadbeats.
[E1B4_TAUNT_06:E1B4AUD]
~z~Fuck the A.O.D.

[E1B4_TAUNT2_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Ha ha, Deadbeats.
[E1B4_TAUNT2_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Billy's here now, assholes.
[E1B4_TAUNT2_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Shouldn't have pissed us off. Right?
[E1B4_TAUNT2_04:E1B4AUD]
~z~The Lost don't forgive, Deadbeats.
[E1B4_TAUNT2_05:E1B4AUD]
~z~Wakey, wakey.
[E1B4_TAUNT2_06:E1B4AUD]
~z~Billy, Billy, come on.

[E1B4_IN_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Into the clubhouse, soldiers.
[E1B4_IN_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Let's get in there, men. Come on.

[E1B4_OUT_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~These guys are wasted man, take 'em out.
[E1B4_OUT_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Get the Deadbeats in the bar, Johnny.
[E1B4_OUT_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Bar's closed, assholes. Get 'em, John boy.

[E1B4_BURN_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Poor bastard.
[E1B4_BURN_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Damn that smells.
[E1B4_BURN_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~He's done.

[E1B4_STAIR_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Get that Deadbeat on the stairs.
[E1B4_STAIR_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Asshole on the stairs, Johnny.
[E1B4_STAIR_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~You gonna take out that Deadbeat on the stairs or do I gotta do everything?

[E1B4_BASEM_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Bury these fucks, Johnny.
[E1B4_BASEM_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Take out the Deadbeats, Johnny.
[E1B4_BASEM_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~These Deadbeats ain't getting outta this hole, brother.

[E1B4_BASE2_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~We're outta here.

[E1B4_CLEAR_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Let's get the fuck outta here. Every man for himself.
[E1B4_CLEAR_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~So long, brothers. Wash the taste of gun powder out your mouths with a cold American beer.

[E1B4_RIGHT_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Check the Deadbeats down that alleyway, Johnny.
[E1B4_RIGHT_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Hey, Johnny. A.O.D. coming from the right.
[E1B4_RIGHT_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~You best look to the right, my brother. More of our friends are coming.

[E1B4_BDEAD_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Bye bye, Billy.

[E1B4_DROPB_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Billy's bought it, oh shit. Oh shit. What're we going to do! We're fucked!
[E1B4_DROPB_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Calm down, Brian. The brothers can pull through this. Now get the fuck out of my face.

[E1B4_BRDEAD_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Brian, you got yourself killed you fucking moron.

[E1B4_DROP_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~We said adios to another brother today, Johnny. 
[E1B4_DROP_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Maybe you should start thinking about what that means to you. 
[E1B4_DROP_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~Thanks for the homework, Bill. 
[E1B4_DROP_7:E1B4AUD]
~z~You want me to give you a thousand words on brotherhood for tomorrow, you asshole?

[E1B4_BIKE_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Would you look at that.

[E1B4_BIKE2_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Oh man. My bike. 

[E1B4_BRFUCK_1:E1B4AUD]

[E1B4_JBIKE_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Dude. That's fucked.

[E1B4_JFUCK_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~I appreciate the ride, William.
[E1B4_JFUCK_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Think nothing of it, brother. We have all got to pull together in this climate of war and uncertainty.

[E1B4_USE_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~What? Nah.

[E1B4_DROPG_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~There's a lesson to be learned here. Resources aren't limitless, Johnny.
[E1B4_DROPG_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Sure, yeah. I'm sorry for not having enough explosives to fuel your war efforts, Billy. See you.

[E1B4_TGENF_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Well, this is the mother of all fuckups.

[E1B4_DROPT_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Shit, man. Today weren't a good day for our chapter. 
[E1B4_DROPT_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~No, it wasn't. But what doesn't kill us only... 
[E1B4_DROPT_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~Ha ha ha. If you believe that you're a fucking chump. See you round.

[E1B4_CGENF_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Hot damn. Hot damn.

[E1B4_DROPC_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Don't know about you, but I'm gonna smoke some haze and get me a woman. Take my mind off shit.
[E1B4_DROPC_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Nothing gonna help me forget this shit. See you around, Clay.

[E1B4_JGENF_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Oh shit. There it is.

[E1B4_DROPJ_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~That's got to be the last nail in our chapter's casket, don't it?
[E1B4_DROPJ_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Maybe. Maybe. At least you got Jackie and the kid.
[E1B4_DROPJ_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~Our chapter was all I had, Jim. I'll see you round.

[E1B4_AB_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~A biker without a bike. You're one sorry S.O.B., John boy.
[E1B4_AB_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Yeah, I sure am, Bill. Thanks for pointin' out the glaringly obvious one more time. Later, man.

[E1B4_MORE_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~We got more Deadbeats coming at us.
[E1B4_MORE_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Shit. It's like we woke up a whole nest of assholes.
[E1B4_MORE_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Man, these Deadbeats just keep on comin', don't they.
[E1B4_MORE_04:E1B4AUD]
~z~The AOD reserves are most bounteous, aren't they? 
[E1B4_MORE_05:E1B4AUD]
~z~Shit, there's an army of Deadbeats coming forth, boys.
[E1B4_MORE_06:E1B4AUD]
~z~Looks like we ran into an AOD convention. What fun.

[E1B4_BIKES_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~You're a fucking maniac, man.
[E1B4_BIKES_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~And on their mighty metal steeds they come.
[E1B4_BIKES_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Deadbeats on bikes are still Deadbeats.

[E1B4_AOD1_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~You lost or something, assholes?
[E1B4_AOD1_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~You Losers here for our brown?
[E1B4_AOD1_04:E1B4AUD]
~z~No one sets fire to AOD property and lives to tell it.
[E1B4_AOD1_05:E1B4AUD]
~z~We ain't Deadbeats, but you're all fucking dead.
[E1B4_AOD1_06:E1B4AUD]
~z~It sure is war, isn't it, Losers?

[E1B4_AOD2_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~You're not getting the drugs, Losers.

~z~Lost MC are a bunch of liberal pussies. 

[E1B4_DBBF_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Everything is fucking up around me, man. My bike... my brothers too. 
[E1B4_DBBF_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~The brothers are doing what you tell 'em to. Maybe that's the problem, Bill. Adios. 

[BG04_AA_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~So where did you get them from?
[BG04_AA_2:E1B4AUD]
~z~Oh, y'know, from a little contact I have 
[BG04_AA_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~who really wants you to cut me out of the loop...
[BG04_AA_4:E1B4AUD]

[BG04_AA_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~All kind of shit is out there, 
[BG04_AA_6:E1B4AUD]
~z~Billy, all you gotta do is grab it. 
[BG04_AA_7:E1B4AUD]

[BG04_AA_8:E1B4AUD]
~z~A shit grabber?
[BG04_AA_9:E1B4AUD]
~z~Huh! Shit grabber!

~z~Wow! See, I like how you did that - it was very good, very clever.
[BG04_AA_11:E1B4AUD]

[BG04_AA_12:E1B4AUD]
~z~Johnny - have you met Ray? 
[BG04_AA_13:E1B4AUD]

[BG04_AA_27:E1B4AUD]
~z~Johnny - you seem a little tense lately - have you ever considered some analysis? 
[BG04_AA_28:E1B4AUD]
~z~Maybe a day spa? High colonic?
[BG04_AA_29:E1B4AUD]
~z~Colonic!

~z~What the fuck is wrong with you man?
[BG04_CA_6:E1B4AUD]
~z~What are you talking about?
[BG04_CA_7:E1B4AUD]
~z~These Deadbeats are the ones who killed Jason in Broker. 
[BG04_CA_8:E1B4AUD]
~z~I thought it was a Pole or a Serb or something?
[BG04_CA_9:E1B4AUD]
~z~We got some bad information, brother. These are the guys. 
[BG04_CA_10:E1B4AUD]

~z~Yes they did. 
[BG04_CA_15:E1B4AUD]
~z~Now take one of these grenades and put it through their window. 
[BG04_CA_16:E1B4AUD]
~z~The Almighty forgives, Johnny. The Lost don't.
[BG04_CA_17:E1B4AUD]
~z~Yeah, amen Johnny boy.

[BG04_CB_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~The Deadbeats have got themselves one shit-load of heroin. 
[BG04_CB_2:E1B4AUD]
~z~Pack it up, Johnny.
[BG04_CB_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Wait I don't understand - 
[BG04_CB_4:E1B4AUD]
~z~I thought this was payback for Jason, man, what the fuck is this?
[BG04_CB_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~Two million in arm candy's as good a payback as I can think of. 
[BG04_CB_6:E1B4AUD]
~z~-Come on brother. ~n~-Jesus, hold your fucking horses, man.
[BG04_CB_7:E1B4AUD]
~z~Now we're gonna steal their smack? Slow down.
[BG04_CB_8:E1B4AUD]
~z~Slow down? Hold up, wait, ooohhhh. 
[BG04_CB_9:E1B4AUD]
~z~Jesus, physics lesson, fuckball. 
[BG04_CB_10:E1B4AUD]
~z~Do you know how motorcycles work? 
[BG04_CB_11:E1B4AUD]
~z~Do ya Johnny? 
[BG04_CB_12:E1B4AUD]
~z~You about to get schooled.
[BG04_CB_13:E1B4AUD]
~z~Centrifugal inertia. 
[BG04_CB_14:E1B4AUD]
~z~Meaning the quicker your wheels go, 
[BG04_CB_15:E1B4AUD]
~z~the more stable you are. 
[BG04_CB_16:E1B4AUD]
~z~The faster we go, the harder we hit it, 
[BG04_CB_17:E1B4AUD]
~z~the more us brothers pull together. 
[BG04_CB_18:E1B4AUD]
~z~That's why we do what we do, 
[BG04_CB_19:E1B4AUD]
~z~that's how we do what we do. 
[BG04_CB_20:E1B4AUD]
~z~Why, how - they're the same fucking thing. 
[BG04_CB_21:E1B4AUD]
~z~We go faster, longer an' harder and that's how we stay together.
[BG04_CB_22:E1B4AUD]
~z~Brian. Shut up.
[BG04_CB_23:E1B4AUD]
~z~What the fuck are you talking about? 
[BG04_CB_24:E1B4AUD]
~z~You gotta stop reading them shitty internet sites, man, 
[BG04_CB_25:E1B4AUD]
~z~and start thinking about what you're doing to us. 
[BG04_CB_26:E1B4AUD]
~z~We lift this shit right now and every Deadbeat on the east coast 
[BG04_CB_27:E1B4AUD]
~z~is gonna come after our chapter.
[BG04_CB_28:E1B4AUD]
~z~Well, that's something your leader will have to worry about. 
[BG04_CB_29:E1B4AUD]
~z~Not you, soldier. 
[BG04_CB_30:E1B4AUD]
~z~Brian, grab the shit.

[E1B4_BILL_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Billy, man. Just for once I'd like to know what the fuck we're doing before we do it.
[E1B4_BILL_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Having delusions of grandeur, Klebitz?
[E1B4_BILL_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~Shit, yeah, of course. Only the chapter president gets to know what's going on.

[E1B4_BRIAN_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~You ready for this shit, Brian?
[E1B4_BRIAN_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Fucking yes, bitches. 
[E1B4_BRIAN_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~Alright then, let's fucking do it.

[E1B4_BRIAN2_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~Brian, man. What you been doing lately. Sucking Billy's cock, I'm betting. 
[E1B4_BRIAN2_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~I seen a video of Ashley fucking on the internet. You're a chump, Johnny.
[E1B4_BRIAN2_5:E1B4AUD]
~z~I thought you only watched gay porn on the internet, Brian. You're into cock, right?
[E1B4_BRIAN2_7:E1B4AUD]
~z~You think that's funny, asshole?
[E1B4_BRIAN2_9:E1B4AUD]
~z~Tell you what, send me a fucking link to that Ashley video. What do I care what she's up to? We're through. 

[E1B4_COUGH_01:E1B4AUD]

~z~Stay in formation, Johnny. Get behind me.
[E1B4_JFRONT_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~You forgotten your place, soldier? Stay behind the ride captain.
[E1B4_JFRONT_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~You're outta line, John boy. Stick behind me.

[E1B4_SIRENS_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Shit, it's the Man.
[E1B4_SIRENS_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~If it ain't the fucking pigs.
[E1B4_SIRENS_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Here come the cherry tops.

[E1B4_EXP1_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~That'll rattle their cage.

~z~You murdering sons of bitches. 
[E1B4_USEGT_04:E1B4AUD]
~z~Jason was my fucking brother.
[E1B4_USEGT_05:E1B4AUD]

[E1B4_USEGT_06:E1B4AUD]
~z~You're gonna have some scorched-ass corpses. 

[E1B4_INCH_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~I ain't never been in an AOD clubhouse.
[E1B4_INCH_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Sorry to intrude, gentlemen. But we got a little business matter.
[E1B4_INCH_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~Ain't you gonna invite us in?
[E1B4_INCH_04:E1B4AUD]
~z~Hello there, assholes.
[E1B4_INCH_05:E1B4AUD]
~z~Don't mind me, fuckers. Stay down.
[E1B4_INCH_06:E1B4AUD]
~z~You ever heard of Jason Michaels? He was a brother of mine.

[E1B4_BASE_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~What you lurking down here for?
[E1B4_BASE_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Hit the weights, fuckheads.
[E1B4_BASE_03:E1B4AUD]
~z~You're gonna die down here, assholes.

[E1B4_SRACE_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~How 'bout we drop the hammer on this run, Billy. Make shit interesting.
[E1B4_SRACE_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Let's go.

[E1B4_JWIN_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~The V.P. takes it. Fuck yeah.
[E1B4_JWIN_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~No disrespect in beating you, Bill. I'm still your humble servant.

[E1B4_JLOSE_01:E1B4AUD]
~z~Good race, man. You fuckin' dropped it.
[E1B4_JLOSE_02:E1B4AUD]
~z~Oh, shit, you sonofabitch. I was hoping you'd go OTB or somethin'. Good driving.

[E1B4_SRACE2_1:E1B4AUD]
~z~How about we inject some speed into proceedings, Mr. President. See if you still got it?
[E1B4_SRACE2_3:E1B4AUD]
~z~Let's have some fun, bitch.


{Buyer's Market}

~z~The coast is cleared. Come on, Playboy.

[E1B5_STAIR_1:E1B5AUD]
~z~Buyer is some Asian dude called Charlie.
[E1B5_STAIR_3:E1B5AUD]
~z~Like in Vietnam?
[E1B5_STAIR_5:E1B5AUD]
~z~Just like the movies, money.

[E1B5_RAGE_01:E1B5AUD]
~z~Screw you!
[E1B5_RAGE_02:E1B5AUD]
~z~Fuck off!
[E1B5_RAGE_03:E1B5AUD]
~z~Fuck you!

[E1B5_BDEAD_1:E1B5AUD]
~z~Oh Johnny. What have you got to tell me?
[E1B5_BDEAD_3:E1B5AUD]
~z~I got good news and I got bad news. The bad news is we've lost a brother. The good news is it's Brian.
[E1B5_BDEAD_5:E1B5AUD]
~z~I don't appreciate you making light of this, Jonathan. Come back to see me. 

[E1B5_SCREW_1:E1B5AUD]
~z~Jonathan?
[E1B5_SCREW_3:E1B5AUD]
~z~William. Things went bad. I couldn't offload that borrowed stuff of yours. 
[E1B5_SCREW_5:E1B5AUD]
~z~Maybe you should give it back to the Deadbeats.
[E1B5_SCREW_7:E1B5AUD]
~z~Maybe I should stick to making those calls, because maybe I'm the boss. Come see me.

[E1B5_PASS_1:E1B5AUD]
~z~So Johnny, are we rich?
[E1B5_PASS_3:E1B5AUD]
~z~No Billy, we're not. What we are is under observation by some 
[E1B5_PASS_4:E1B5AUD]
~z~kind of LCPD drugs task force. The buyer was a pig. 
[E1B5_PASS_6:E1B5AUD]
~z~Hell Johnny, that's not kosher. I'll call you when another buyer's lined up.
[E1B5_PASS_7:E1B5AUD]
~z~Sounds good.
[E1B5_PASS_8:E1B5AUD]
~z~We are moving up in the world, Johnny.
[E1B5_PASS_10:E1B5AUD]
~z~There's a Congressman, needs your help, Tom Stubbs III.
[E1B5_PASS_12:E1B5AUD]
~z~I told you keeping that lawyer around would have its uses.
[E1B5_PASS_14:E1B5AUD]
~z~This guy's at one of them dumb ass gentlemen's clubs in Algonquin - the kind without tits - The Jousters.
[E1B5_PASS_16:E1B5AUD]
~z~Politicians and lawyers? What are we becoming, man? 
[E1B5_PASS_18:E1B5AUD]
~z~Next thing you're gonna tell me we're doing some shit kicking for the LCPD.
[E1B5_PASS_20:E1B5AUD]
~z~It's just opposite the Libertonian. Go pay him a visit, if you're still thinking about your brothers and not just your own ego, that is.

[BG05_AA_1:E1B5AUD]
~z~Hey, hey, Johnny, the big bad biker man.
[BG05_AA_2:E1B5AUD]
~z~Liz Torres, the meanest bitch in Bohan.
[BG05_AA_3:E1B5AUD]
~z~Come here, sweetie.
[BG05_AA_4:E1B5AUD]
~z~Shit, I'd let you kiss me, 
[BG05_AA_5:E1B5AUD]
~z~but I'm afraid you'd stick a knife in my back while I was doin' it.
[BG05_AA_6:E1B5AUD]
~z~You wouldn't be the first man I'd tried that trick on, sweetie.
[BG05_AA_7:E1B5AUD]
~z~Yeah, I heard the stories. 
[BG05_AA_8:E1B5AUD]
~z~Listen I also heard you got somebody for that brown?
[BG05_AA_9:E1B5AUD]
~z~Maybe. There's an apartment on Cassidy Street in Schottler. 
[BG05_AA_10:E1B5AUD]
~z~You go upstairs and talk to Charlie on the third floor.
[BG05_AA_11:E1B5AUD]
~z~There any heat?
[BG05_AA_12:E1B5AUD]
~z~When isn't there? 
[BG05_AA_13:E1B5AUD]
~z~I've got a new guy going along with you. 
[BG05_AA_14:E1B5AUD]
~z~He's from Eastern Europe somewheres.
[BG05_AA_15:E1B5AUD]
~z~If the heat's coming from Charlie, 
[BG05_AA_16:E1B5AUD]
~z~use this Slavic motherfucker to help. But if it's him. 
[BG05_AA_17:E1B5AUD]
~z~You know what you gotta do.
[BG05_AA_18:E1B5AUD]
~z~Well either way it ain't coming back to you, Liz.
[BG05_AA_19:E1B5AUD]
~z~Ah, you know Playboy? He's going along, too. 
[BG05_AA_20:E1B5AUD]
~z~Hey Playboy!
[BG05_AA_21:E1B5AUD]
~z~Yo, chill for a second yo.
[BG05_AA_22:E1B5AUD]
~z~Nah, not really.
[BG05_AA_23:E1B5AUD]
~z~Don't you wanna dance? 
[BG05_AA_24:E1B5AUD]
~z~Nah, I'll just sit right here and wait for your boy.

[BG05_CA_1:E1B5AUD]
~z~Gimme that shit man. We got a buyer.
[BG05_CA_2:E1B5AUD]
~z~I don't know why Billy got you to handle this and not me. 
[BG05_CA_3:E1B5AUD]
~z~I mean, what's up with that, eh? 
[BG05_CA_4:E1B5AUD]
~z~I guess you Semites are good at sniffing out a deal, 
[BG05_CA_5:E1B5AUD]
~z~ain't that right, Johnny?
[BG05_CA_6:E1B5AUD]
~z~He didn't get you because Liz Torres, 
[BG05_CA_7:E1B5AUD]
~z~and any other two bit hustler on the street 
[BG05_CA_8:E1B5AUD]
~z~would take you for the little pussy that you are and rob you blind. 
[BG05_CA_9:E1B5AUD]
~z~Now gimme that shit.
[BG05_CA_10:E1B5AUD]
~z~See you around big guy.

[BG05_HIA_1:E1B5AUD]
~z~Yo.
[BG05_HIA_2:E1B5AUD]
~z~Hey man.

[BG05_ROOF_01:E1B5AUD]
~z~Split up. You head for the roof, I'll go down! Fuck 'em all.
[BG05_ROOF_02:E1B5AUD]
~z~Time to part company. You head up and I'll go down. 
[BG05_ROOF_03:E1B5AUD]
~z~Get the fuck outta here. I'll go down, you go up. Good luck.

[BG05_AB_1:E1B5AUD]
~z~Surround yourself with cocaine and the assholes soon follow.
[BG05_AB_2:E1B5AUD]
~z~Hey, Johnny!
[BG05_AB_3:E1B5AUD]
~z~Yo! 
[BG05_AB_4:E1B5AUD]
~z~Come over here. 
[BG05_AB_5:E1B5AUD]
~z~Come here. 
[BG05_AB_6:E1B5AUD]
~z~Yeah!
[BG05_AB_7:E1B5AUD]
~z~Niko, this is Johnny.
[BG05_AB_8:E1B5AUD]
~z~Now, Johnny is sitting on a big pile of heroin.
[BG05_AB_9:E1B5AUD]
~z~I don't go near the stuff... professionally... but I found him a buyer. 
[BG05_AB_10:E1B5AUD]
~z~We're nervous. Will you oversee the deal and check everything is cool?
[BG05_AB_11:E1B5AUD]
~z~Sure.
[BG05_AB_12:E1B5AUD]
~z~Thank you.
[BG05_AB_13:E1B5AUD]
~z~Well, I got to go pick up the stuff so, uh, I'll see you there.
[BG05_AB_14:E1B5AUD]
~z~A'ight. 


{This Shit's Cursed}

[E1B6_FOLLOB_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Stick close, brothers.
[E1B6_FOLLOB_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Follow the ride captain.
[E1B6_FOLLOB_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Let's do this.

[E1B6_FOLLOJ_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Let's get out of here.
[E1B6_FOLLOJ_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Let's go. Let's go.
[E1B6_FOLLOJ_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Stay close, brother.
[E1B6_FOLLOJ_04:E1B6AUD]
~z~Come on, man. Let's go.
[E1B6_FOLLOJ_05:E1B6AUD]
~z~Move it, brother.

[E1B6_COME_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Get over here.
[E1B6_COME_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Come here, Johnny.
[E1B6_COME_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Johnny, man. Come here.

[E1B6_ESCAPE_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~The cops are all over us, man. We've got to lose them.
[E1B6_ESCAPE_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Johnny, man. We've got to lose this heat.
[E1B6_ESCAPE_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~We can't let the pigs take us, too. Come on.

[E1B6_EAT_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~You said we had a deal.
[E1B6_EAT_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~You went back on your word.
[E1B6_EAT_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~We had an arrangement.
[E1B6_EAT_04:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck this.
[E1B6_EAT_05:E1B6AUD]
~z~Just take the shit.

[E1B6_COVER_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Get behind something, Johnny!
[E1B6_COVER_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Keep your head down, John!
[E1B6_COVER_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~You trying to get yourself killed, Johnny?
[E1B6_COVER_04:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck Johnny! Get cover!

[E1B6_MORE_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~How many of these Triads are there?
[E1B6_MORE_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~We're being swamped here, Johnny.
[E1B6_MORE_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Here come more of them, Johnny.
[E1B6_MORE_04:E1B6AUD]
~z~Watch yourself, Johnny. We got more here.
[E1B6_MORE_05:E1B6AUD]
~z~Looks like they were prepared for this, Johnny.

[E1B6_SURP_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Where did he come from?
[E1B6_SURP_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Watch it, Johnny.
[E1B6_SURP_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shit, Johnny. Look out.

[E1B6_CHAT1_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Where the hell did Billy go?
[E1B6_CHAT1_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~He's looking out for us... apparently.

[E1B6_CHAT2_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Nothing like a firefight to make the blood boil, eh Jim?
[E1B6_CHAT2_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Didn't particularly enjoy combat when I was in the marines, Johnny. 
[E1B6_CHAT2_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Sure as shit don't like it now.

[E1B6_CHAT3_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'm surprised Brian isn't here fighting alongside us.
[E1B6_CHAT3_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'm surprised Brian's got balls enough to leave the house.

[E1B6_CHAT4_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Life wouldn't be worth living if we didn't to fight to survive. Ain't that right Jim?
[E1B6_CHAT4_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Maybe if you don't got anyone to look after, Johnny.

[E1B6_BIL2V1_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Tell me if I'm wrong, but you know more about this deal than you're letting on?
[E1B6_BIL2V1_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~You're wrong, brother. 
[E1B6_BIL2V1_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~I think you knew more about the brown when we found it at the Deabeats pad and I think you know more now. 
[E1B6_BIL2V1_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~But you're the leader, so that's the way it goes.

[E1B6_BIL1V2_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Cops are poking round, Bill. We should chill out. 
[E1B6_BIL1V2_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~You haven't been talking have you? Don't go forgetting what happened when Horse sang his little ditty.
[E1B6_BIL1V2_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'd never talk to a pig. But there's a lesson to be learned, alright.

[E1B6_BIL2V2_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Johnny, you're wasting away, man. I think it's all the worrying you do. Why don't you hit the weights later?
[E1B6_BIL2V2_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~You're not as big as those days when you hit the 'roids either, William.
[E1B6_BIL2V2_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~My arms might not be
[E1B6_BIL2V2_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~but there's other parts that are a lot bigger now I'm off the drugs. Just ask Ashley.

[E1B6_BRI1V1_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Giving it up to the slopes. It don't feel right.
[E1B6_BRI1V1_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Well, Billy says we're doing it. So get doing it.
[E1B6_BRI1V1_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'm not the one with an authority problem, Johnny.

[E1B6_BRI1V2_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~You ever had a girlfriend, Brian?
[E1B6_BRI1V2_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Not gonna waste my time with that crap. I got the brothers. All the hole I need at the house, man. Yeah! 
[E1B6_BRI1V2_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Too right, man. Guy like you shouldn't waste his time with all that shit. 

[E1B6_JIM1V1_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'm surprised Billy agreed to this. It's the first smart move he's made since gettin' out of rehab.
[E1B6_JIM1V1_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Yeah. Maybe he's starting to calm down.
[E1B6_JIM1V1_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Maybe he's stuck too much of that brown into his arm then.

[E1B6_JIM1V2_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~How'd you find out that H belonged to the Triads?
[E1B6_JIM1V2_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~They got word out all over town.
[E1B6_JIM1V2_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Brought it into Liberty on a ship called the Platypus a few weeks back.
[E1B6_JIM1V2_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shit, Jim. You're just a font of information, aren't you? 

[E1B6_FIND_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Alright brothers. They're somewhere in here. Follow me.
[E1B6_FIND_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Follow me, brothers. They're somewhere in here.
[E1B6_FIND_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Let us find these men and get it over with. Follow me, my brothers.

[E1B6_HELLO_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Didn't think you guys were going to make it.
[E1B6_HELLO_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Oh you're here. Great.
[E1B6_HELLO_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Great to see you guys. Shame Billy couldn't make it.

[E1B6_FOLLO_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~We need to take a hard look at things. Follow me back to the house.
[E1B6_FOLLO_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Okay, we gotta sort shit out. Tail me over to the house.

[E1B6_DROPB_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Billy's inside and Jim's gone for good. You're a real lucky charm, buddy.
[E1B6_DROPB_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'm too tired to start playing the blame game with you, Brian. 
[E1B6_DROPB_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Get lost before I put my foot in your face. OK buddy?

[E1B6_BIKE_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Aw, man. What happened? 

[E1B6_DBBB_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shit, man. There must be some weird gremlins fucking with my machine. She ran smooth earlier.
[E1B6_DBBB_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Sure she did. Probably ran good before you touched her. Get out my face, Brian.

[E1B6_FAIL_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Klebitz, man. What the fuck? What the fuck? 
[E1B6_FAIL_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Another deal fucked up in Liberty City. Don't look so surprised, man. Adios. 

[E1B6_CH1_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Why couldn't you save Billy?
[E1B6_CH1_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~What do you mean? Johnny and I were getting jumped. Why weren't you helping Billy?
[E1B6_CH1_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~I had to help myself, man. I mean, I can't be expected to... 
[E1B6_CH1_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~Billy doesn't have any beef, he's not trucking any bad shit with me. 

[E1B6_CH2_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Johnny, man. We got to have a meet for all the brothers when we get back. Tell 'em what happened. 
[E1B6_CH2_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Yeah. I'm real keen to tell the brothers what went down.
[E1B6_CH2_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Alright, Brian. I'd like to know what the fuck went down as well.

[E1B6_CH3_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Brian, man, what the fuck were you and Billy doing while those Triads jumped on me and Jim?
[E1B6_CH3_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~We were watching your back, man. Looking out for you brothers. Doing more than you did for Billy.
[E1B6_CH3_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~That's bullshit. If you were looking out for us, where were you when me and Johhny had to fight our way outta there? 

[E1B6_CH4_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Important question, Brian. What happened there? Billy said these Triads were ready to deal.
[E1B6_CH4_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~You must have fucked shit up, Johnny. Billy never wanted to make nice in the first place.
[E1B6_CH4_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fine, okay. I'm just hoping my brothers didn't send me into an ambush.

[E1B6_CH5_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~You're gonna have to take over the chapter presidency, Johnny. Only thing for it.
[E1B6_CH5_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Not if I got anything to say on it. Not if Billy hears about this.
[E1B6_CH5_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Save it for Church, Brian.

[E1B6_TRIAD_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~You have slighted our honor!
[E1B6_TRIAD_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~This country is finished!
[E1B6_TRIAD_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~A new power is rising. You shall see.
[E1B6_TRIAD_04:E1B6AUD]
~z~Foolish Americans! Your greed has ruined you yet again.
[E1B6_TRIAD_05:E1B6AUD]
~z~You have walked into a trap, fools!
[E1B6_TRIAD_06:E1B6AUD]
~z~We will take the product and your lives!

[E1B6_LJIM_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~We still got shit to deal with here, Johnny.
[E1B6_LJIM_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Don't leave a brother behind, John.
[E1B6_LJIM_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Jonathan. We got work to do here.
[E1B6_LJIM_04:E1B6AUD]
~z~Yo, Johnny! Where you going?
[E1B6_LJIM_05:E1B6AUD]
~z~Get back here, man.

[E1B6_BL1V1_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~You love sniffing out a deal, don't you Johnny?
[E1B6_BL1V1_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~You just love sniffing out an argument, Billy boy. Enjoy the ride for a minute. Mellow out.
[E1B6_BL1V1_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Nothing mellow about what you're about to walk into, brother. Watch out.

[E1B6_SQUAT_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Where is she?
[E1B6_SQUAT_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Hey, man. Hey, hey, huh? What, what, what, what you looking for? 
[E1B6_SQUAT_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~You wanna fuck? Huh? I'm kinda crazy right now.
[E1B6_SQUAT_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~You know who I'm looking for. Where's Ashley?
[E1B6_SQUAT_9:E1B6AUD]
~z~Look, man. Look, look, look. I been up for three days, man. 
[E1B6_SQUAT_11:E1B6AUD]
~z~You do not want to push me. No, you do not. 
[E1B6_SQUAT_13:E1B6AUD]
~z~You had your chance.

[E1B6_SLIDE_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shit, it's the heat!

[E1B6_WALK1_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~What was that all about?
[E1B6_WALK1_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~I dunno, man. Billy sounded pissed.
[E1B6_WALK1_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~He's gonna have plenty of time to think about his anger on the inside.
[E1B6_WALK1_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~Well, why'd he bring me into it?
[E1B6_WALK1_9:E1B6AUD]
~z~We got more important things to think about. Without Billy we got no leader. 
[E1B6_WALK1_11:E1B6AUD]
~z~You're gonna have to take charge of the chapter, man.
[E1B6_WALK1_13:E1B6AUD]
~z~It's like being made Captain of a sinkin' ship. What am I gonna do?
[E1B6_WALK1_15:E1B6AUD]
~z~You're gonna stick by your brothers. We got to pull together now.
[E1B6_WALK1_17:E1B6AUD]
~z~You're right about that.
[E1B6_WALK1_19:E1B6AUD]
~z~Let's see what Brian's got to say for himself.

[E1B6_WALK2_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Now I'm just confused.
[E1B6_WALK2_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Me too. 
[E1B6_WALK2_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Where the fuck were Billy and his little bitch during that shit storm? 
[E1B6_WALK2_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~They sure as hell weren't covering us.
[E1B6_WALK2_9:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck, man. Billy's gonna go away for good with those priors of his. 
[E1B6_WALK2_11:E1B6AUD]
~z~You should take over as Chapter President, Johnny.
[E1B6_WALK2_13:E1B6AUD]
~z~After that shit Billy was saying, you think we'll still have a chapter?
[E1B6_WALK2_15:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck 'em, man. The two of us are chapter enough and Terry 'n' Clay will back you up when you need it. 
[E1B6_WALK2_17:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck me, man. 
[E1B6_WALK2_19:E1B6AUD]
~z~Now let's find out what Brian's got to say.

[E1B6_MEET_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'm gonna call Terry and the rest of 'em. Set up a meet.
[E1B6_MEET_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'm calling the brothers. We got to talk about this shit. 

[BG06_BA_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~You set me up, Johnny. 
[BG06_BA_2:E1B6AUD]
~z~You set me up.
[BG06_BA_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Put your hands in the air.
[BG06_BA_4:E1B6AUD]
~z~Now!
[BG06_BA_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck you, Johnny. 
[BG06_BA_6:E1B6AUD]
~z~You're dead!
[BG06_BA_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shut your God damn mouth, shut your mouth!
[BG06_BA_8:E1B6AUD]
~z~You're dead!
[BG06_BA_9:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shut up!

[BG06_CA_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Jesus. That was heavy, man. Fuck it.
[BG06_CA_2:E1B6AUD]
~z~What was Billy's fucking problem?
[BG06_CA_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Nothing wrong with him, buddy. 
[BG06_CA_4:E1B6AUD]
~z~You two want us to end up all dead? 
[BG06_CA_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Man, Billy was right about you. 
[BG06_CA_6:E1B6AUD]
~z~I knew you were a rat, now he's gone, man. 
[BG06_CA_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~He ain't gone, Brian, he's gone to prison. 
[BG06_CA_8:E1B6AUD]
~z~He's not dead.
[BG06_CA_9:E1B6AUD]
~z~You ratted him out! You ratted him out!
[BG06_CA_10:E1B6AUD]
~z~No I didn't. He nearly got me fucking killed. 
[BG06_CA_11:E1B6AUD]
~z~You set us up - you've always wanted to be the one - 
[BG06_CA_12:E1B6AUD]
~z~the man - you're a gimp, Johnny. 
[BG06_CA_13:E1B6AUD]
~z~A gimp and a fucking Judas. 
[BG06_CA_14:E1B6AUD]
~z~What the fuck are you talking about, 
[BG06_CA_15:E1B6AUD]
~z~you ass kissing little weasel?
[BG06_CA_16:E1B6AUD]
~z~Hey Brian. Johnny's not like that, man.
[BG06_CA_17:E1B6AUD]
~z~Jim, you're wrong, man. I know you're a good guy - 
[BG06_CA_18:E1B6AUD]
~z~but this Jew prick. He fucked us over, man. 
[BG06_CA_19:E1B6AUD]
~z~He set us up and he called the cops. 
[BG06_CA_20:E1B6AUD]
~z~And you know why? 
[BG06_CA_21:E1B6AUD]
~z~Because they're putting heat on him. 
[BG06_CA_22:E1B6AUD]
~z~They saw him and they've been calling him... 
[BG06_CA_23:E1B6AUD]
~z~I know, because they did the same to me, 
[BG06_CA_24:E1B6AUD]
~z~and they told me you ratted us out. 
[BG06_CA_25:E1B6AUD]
~z~You keep talking like that - you are dead, my little friend. 
[BG06_CA_26:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck you, man. 
[BG06_CA_27:E1B6AUD]
~z~What?
[BG06_CA_28:E1B6AUD]
~z~You sent Billy to jail. 
[BG06_CA_29:E1B6AUD]
~z~Show us your phone, 
[BG06_CA_30:E1B6AUD]
~z~prove you ain't been speaking to the law. 
[BG06_CA_31:E1B6AUD]
~z~I don't prove shit to you and I didn't talk to no one. 
[BG06_CA_32:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck it... c'mon!
[BG06_CA_33:E1B6AUD]
~z~You stay away from us, you hear?

[BG06_CB_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Alright. Jim, Johnny, 
[BG06_CB_2:E1B6AUD]
~z~since you two were both so vocal in your support of this deal. 
[BG06_CB_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~You two are going to be the ones to hand over the brown to the slopes. 
[BG06_CB_4:E1B6AUD]
~z~What? What are you and your boy here going to be doing?
[BG06_CB_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~We are gonna watch your backs, 
[BG06_CB_6:E1B6AUD]
~z~because unlike this fat man here, 
[BG06_CB_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~I just don't trust those little yellow bastards. 
[BG06_CB_8:E1B6AUD]
~z~Good luck.
[BG06_CB_9:E1B6AUD]
~z~Hey, they don't need luck, we're looking out for them.
[BG06_CB_10:E1B6AUD]
~z~This better be cool man.

[BG06_P4_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~So Johnny this uh, 
[BG06_P4_2:E1B6AUD]
~z~Mmm..
[BG06_P4_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Okay.
[BG06_P4_4:E1B6AUD]
~z~We gonna be cool and do this thing?
[BG06_P4_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~So let me get this straight. 
[BG06_P4_6:E1B6AUD]
~z~You are here to sell us back our heroin. 
[BG06_P4_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~The heroin my cousins sweated over in order to bring to this country 
[BG06_P4_8:E1B6AUD]
~z~only to have it stolen?
[BG06_P4_9:E1B6AUD]
~z~Look man we can do business or go to war. 
[BG06_P4_10:E1B6AUD]
~z~It's your call.
[BG06_P4_11:E1B6AUD]
~z~In this country they seem to be the same thing, 
[BG06_P4_12:E1B6AUD]
~z~you stupid pieces of shit.
[BG06_P4_13:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck you!

[BG06_AA_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Billy, I just don't see how we have a choice man. 
[BG06_AA_2:E1B6AUD]
~z~I have a choice - I'm free. I'm not a slave. 
[BG06_AA_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~I have a choice. 
[BG06_AA_4:E1B6AUD]
~z~Jim, I love you man, but since you've hit middle age, you've really lost something... 
[BG06_AA_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Yeah and since you've fucking been strung out on this shit 
[BG06_AA_6:E1B6AUD]
~z~you've lost something - your fucking mind.
[BG06_AA_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~Easy Jim, look who the fuck you're speaking to huh.
[BG06_AA_8:E1B6AUD]
~z~Hey, 
[BG06_AA_9:E1B6AUD]
~z~What's up?
[BG06_AA_10:E1B6AUD]
~z~I'm just trying to explain to our friend here - 
[BG06_AA_11:E1B6AUD]
~z~that possession is nine tenths of the law - 
[BG06_AA_12:E1B6AUD]
~z~we should make the slopes pay us back.
[BG06_AA_13:E1B6AUD]
~z~Billy, I've got Chad on the phone!
[BG06_AA_14:E1B6AUD]
~z~Pay us back for what?
[BG06_AA_15:E1B6AUD]
~z~Look we have a business opportunity here Johnny. 
[BG06_AA_16:E1B6AUD]
~z~I think a guy like you should be pleased.
[BG06_AA_17:E1B6AUD]
~z~Yeah but Jim says there's some problem.
[BG06_AA_18:E1B6AUD]
~z~There is - that H we stole - it belonged to the Chinese. 
[BG06_AA_19:E1B6AUD]
~z~The Deadbeats told them we got it and they want it back.
[BG06_AA_20:E1B6AUD]
~z~So? Fuck 'em.
[BG06_AA_21:E1B6AUD]
~z~Finally!
[BG06_AA_22:E1B6AUD]
~z~Billy - 
[BG06_AA_23:E1B6AUD]
~z~Chad's on the phone about the meeting.
[BG06_AA_24:E1B6AUD]
~z~Look normally I'd be down for that, 
[BG06_AA_25:E1B6AUD]
~z~but these aren't the type of dudes you say "fuck 'em" to. 
[BG06_AA_26:E1B6AUD]
~z~They're some heavily armed, pissed off motherfuckers, 
[BG06_AA_27:E1B6AUD]
~z~who killed a couple of Angels when they found out their shit was gone. 
[BG06_AA_28:E1B6AUD]
~z~Now I'm thinking maybe we can strike up a deal with them.
[BG06_AA_29:E1B6AUD]
~z~Okay.
[BG06_AA_30:E1B6AUD]
~z~Okay? Why don't you just suck 'em off while you're at it? 
[BG06_AA_31:E1B6AUD]
~z~And tell Chad I'm sober as can be over here. 
[BG06_AA_32:E1B6AUD]
~z~Look I just think that given this war we're back into with the Angels of Death, 
[BG06_AA_33:E1B6AUD]
~z~and given the fact that one or possibly two government agencies 
[BG06_AA_34:E1B6AUD]
~z~are looking into our shit, 
[BG06_AA_35:E1B6AUD]
~z~that offloading the heroin would be a good idea, alright!?
[BG06_AA_36:E1B6AUD]
~z~And looking for a fight, is the wrong thing to do right now
[BG06_AA_37:E1B6AUD]
~z~given the fact that we can't even stop fighting amongst ourselves!
[BG06_AA_38:E1B6AUD]
~z~Yeah, you're right we probably should all get into a circle,
[BG06_AA_39:E1B6AUD]
~z~hold hands, pray, and sing Kum Ba Yah.
[BG06_AA_40:E1B6AUD]
~z~Kum Ba Yah!
[BG06_AA_41:E1B6AUD]
~z~Yeah, whatever...
[BG06_AA_42:E1B6AUD]
~z~This ain't no joking matter, Billy! 
[BG06_AA_43:E1B6AUD]
~z~We'll either end up dead in the ground,
[BG06_AA_44:E1B6AUD]
~z~or back in the lockup with you!
[BG06_AA_45:E1B6AUD]
~z~I ain't going back there. I'd rather be dead.
[BG06_AA_46:E1B6AUD]
~z~Damn straight.
[BG06_AA_47:E1B6AUD]
~z~Well you don't have to do either, man.
[BG06_AA_48:E1B6AUD]
~z~I just think that getting rid of that stuff now is the right thing to do.
[BG06_AA_49:E1B6AUD]
~z~Okay.

[BG06_ABA_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~This shit is fucked up. 
[BG06_ABA_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Billy, man, what the fuck?
[BG06_ABA_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Dude. This is some bad shit.

[BG06_ACB_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Let's get back to the bikes. 
[BG06_ACB_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Dude, this feels weird. Let's get to the bikes.
[BG06_ACB_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Man, let's just get back to the bikes.

[BG06_JIM1_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Jim, dude, you ready for this?
[BG06_JIM1_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Yeah, baby.
[BG06_JIM1_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Alright then.

[BG06_JIM2_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Brian here says he wants to suck your cock too, Jim.
[BG06_JIM2_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Fuck off.
[BG06_JIM2_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~You hear that, Brian? Looks like it's only Billy gonna let you blow him. 

[BG06_JIM3_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Jim, dude. I'm happy to have you next to me on this run.
[BG06_JIM3_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~My brother!
[BG06_JIM3_4:E1B6AUD]
~z~We're all brothers, man. Lost MC. 

[BG06_BRIAN_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Billy fucked Ashley, man. I watched them.
[BG06_BRIAN_2:E1B6AUD]
~z~Thanks for that, Brian. Real helpful input. 
[BG06_BRIAN_4:E1B6AUD]
~z~Did you get jealous and wish that Billy was fucking you instead? You'd like that wouldn't you, you fat little bitch?
[BG06_BRIAN_6:E1B6AUD]
~z~Johnny the fucking Jew. 

[BG06_BILLY_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shit, Bill. I don't know where my head is right now. I been feeling weird.
[BG06_BILLY_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Was that because I stuck it to Ashley?
[BG06_BILLY_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~What you guys do is your own business, man? You're both adults. Well, kinda. 

[BG06_WTF_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Klebitz, man, what the fuck? What happened back there?

[E1B6_CBRIAN_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Johnny Klebitz. 
[E1B6_CBRIAN_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~Brian, man. Shit's fucked. Billy's been taken down. Where are you?
[E1B6_CBRIAN_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~Bill, yeah, he's fucked now. Thanks to you. I'm around the corner.
[E1B6_CBRIAN_7:E1B6AUD]
~z~We're coming. Wait there.

[E1B6_PRES_1:E1B6AUD]
~z~Okay, Jim. I guess I got to take over as Chapter President now. 
[E1B6_PRES_3:E1B6AUD]
~z~When people hear about Billy going down, there's gonna be more pressure on us than ever.
[E1B6_PRES_5:E1B6AUD]
~z~We got to get through it. Brothers for life, man. Lost forever. I'll see you soon. 

[E1B6_BILL_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~We're gonna have to fight our way outta here.
[E1B6_BILL_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Getting out ain't gonna be easy. Where's fuckin' Bill?
[E1B6_BILL_03:E1B6AUD]
~z~Where the fuck's Billy?

[E1B6_SRACE_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Okay, Bill, you think you're so tough. How about we light a fucking fire. Come on!
[E1B6_SRACE_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shit, Billy. You're the fucking man. How bout you beat us brothers in a race just to prove it.

[E1B6_JWIN_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~It was a pleasure beating you gentlemen.
[E1B6_JWIN_02:E1B6AUD]
~z~Well, Bill. I may have beat you, but you're still the fucking man in my book. 

[E1B6_JLOSE_01:E1B6AUD]
~z~Shit, good race, sir. Good race.
[E1B6_JLOSE_02:E1B6AUD]

[E1J1_FOLLOW_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~Stick to me, Johnny.
[E1J1_FOLLOW_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~Keep the shiny side up and stick behind me, brother.
[E1J1_FOLLOW_03:E1J1AUD]
~z~I'm point on this run, let's go.

[E1J1_B1V1_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~You been seeing much of Terry and Clay?
[E1J1_B1V1_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Not really, at least not since Billy got back. Shit's been too crazy.
[E1J1_B1V1_5:E1J1AUD]
~z~You should call them, man. They're still cool. Their heads are probably in the same kind of place as yours.

[E1J1_B1V2_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~Feels good to be doing something like this. Not just breaking heads 'cause Billy feels like it.
[E1J1_B1V2_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Or standing round kicking tires and asking what the fucks gone wrong with the chapter.
[E1J1_B1V2_5:E1J1AUD]
~z~Absolutely. Got to keep active, brother. Keep on moving.

[E1J1_TRUCK_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~Get in the truck, Johnny.
[E1J1_TRUCK_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~It ain't as fast as your bike, but this is our ride, Johnny boy.
[E1J1_TRUCK_03:E1J1AUD]
~z~Come on, man. Get in the truck.

[E1J1_AOD_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~These bikes are over by the Deadbeat hangout in Tudor.
[E1J1_AOD_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~The bikes are parked up by the Tudor Chapter's HQ.
[E1J1_AOD_03:E1J1AUD]
~z~They got these bikes at their place near Honkers. Drive us, will ya?

[E1J1_2V1_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~Where'd you get the van, Jim? You ain't turned into some kind of trailer queen have you?
[E1J1_2V1_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Very funny, asshole. This shit belongs to my contact.
[E1J1_2V1_5:E1J1AUD]
~z~If I wanted to take a bike of mine somewhere, I'd drive it myself.
[E1J1_2V1_7:E1J1AUD]
~z~Yeah? Having an old lady and kid hasn't made you scared of getting dirty?
[E1J1_2V1_9:E1J1AUD]
~z~I was riding bikes before your momma rode your daddy, Jonathan.
[E1J1_2V1_11:E1J1AUD]
~z~Jackie and the baby, yeah it's nice and all. And shit, I mean I love them and stuff,
[E1J1_2V1_13:E1J1AUD]
~z~but I'm still a brother. Lost MC, man, forever.
[E1J1_2V1_15:E1J1AUD]
~z~So if Billy asked you to do something that meant you wouldn't be able to look after them
[E1J1_2V1_16:E1J1AUD]
~z~for some time or, or maybe not ever...?
[E1J1_2V1_18:E1J1AUD]
~z~Yeah Johnny, I take your point. I'd have to think long and hard on it, okay? 
[E1J1_2V1_19:E1J1AUD]
~z~But I think long and hard about what I'm gonna order at Burger Shot as well,
[E1J1_2V1_21:E1J1AUD]
~z~I guess I'm the thinking type of maniac.

[E1J1_2V2_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~Who's this contact then?
[E1J1_2V2_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~A guy Angus knows. They met at one of those bike shows.
[E1J1_2V2_5:E1J1AUD]
~z~Yeah?
[E1J1_2V2_7:E1J1AUD]
~z~Shit. That guy knows more about tuning a bike than the rest of the brothers put together, 
[E1J1_2V2_9:E1J1AUD]
~z~but he's the one who can't ride one no more.
[E1J1_2V2_11:E1J1AUD]
~z~Luck's a perverse thing ain't it? How are Jackie and the kid?
[E1J1_2V2_13:E1J1AUD]
~z~You haven't brought them to the house in a while.
[E1J1_2V2_15:E1J1AUD]
~z~Hey man, Jackie can handle herself but it ain't exactly a family friendly environment at the moment, is it? 
[E1J1_2V2_17:E1J1AUD]
~z~You know, when things calm down.

[E1J1_BIKES_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~Load the bikes up, man.
[E1J1_BIKES_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~Get 'em on the trailer, Johnny.

[E1J1_HELP_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~A little help here, man. 
[E1J1_HELP_03:E1J1AUD]
~z~Can you help a brother in need, Johnny?

[E1J1_LAST_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~Alright, that's the all of them. Let's get outta here. 
[E1J1_LAST_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~We got all we can carry, Johnny boy. You and me gotta get outta here.
[E1J1_LAST_03:E1J1AUD]
~z~We got what we came for, brother. Let's move out.

[E1J1_BACK_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~Take her back to the house.
[E1J1_BACK_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~Back to the source, my man.
[E1J1_BACK_03:E1J1AUD]
~z~Head home, Johnny boy.

[E1J1_ROUTE_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~They just don't know when to quit, do they?
[E1J1_ROUTE_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~You'd think the Deadbeats would know when they were beat.
[E1J1_ROUTE_03:E1J1AUD]
~z~Come on, these bikes are ours now.
[E1J1_ROUTE_04:E1J1AUD]
~z~Would somebody tell the Deadbeats that possession is nine tenths of the law.
[E1J1_ROUTE_05:E1J1AUD]
~z~Fucking Deadbeats. Don't know when to leave good enough alone.
[E1J1_ROUTE_06:E1J1AUD]
~z~Screw you, you pricks.
[E1J1_ROUTE_07:E1J1AUD]
~z~Yeah, fuck off.

[E1J1_CALL1_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~This is getting too hot, my brother. Why don't you call the boys in to help.
[E1J1_CALL1_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~Call the boys man, they're closing in on us here.

[E1J1_CLEAR_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~These assholes don't have the balls to follow us to the clubhouse. We're in the clear, man.
[E1J1_CLEAR_02:E1J1AUD]
~z~We're cool, Johnny. The AOD won't come this far into Lost territory. 

[E1J1_DROP_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~I guess you gotta tell your contact he ain't getting those bikes and his truck is screwed.
[E1J1_DROP_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Fuck him, man. He'll deal with it. Later on, Bro.

[E1J1_DROP2_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~Too bad about those bikes, man. We missed out on a payday.
[E1J1_DROP2_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Screw it, my brother. Money's just another thing to worry about. See ya, Johnny boy.

[E1J1_DROP3_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~It's too bad, my brother. I was looking forward to screwing with those Deadbeats.
[E1J1_DROP3_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Another time, my man. So long.

[E1J1_CALL2_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~Hey man, get your asses over here now. Jim and I are in the shit!

[E1J1_DO_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~It's time to stick it to 'em, Johnny.
[E1J1_DO_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Let's do this.

[E1J2_CLAYBK_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~Johnny, man. I thought you'd lost my number.
[E1J2_CLAYBK_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Clay, dude, Me and Jim need some assistance with the AOD.
[E1J2_CLAYBK_5:E1J1AUD]
~z~Man, we're only meant to stand up on the Chapter leader's say so, but who gives a fuck? We'll be there.

[E1J2_TERRBK_1:E1J1AUD]
~z~Jonathan, whatever can I do for you?
[E1J2_TERRBK_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Well, you could save me and Jim's hides from some angry Deadbeats. We need your help.
[E1J2_TERRBK_5:E1J1AUD]
~z~Now, you know only a Chapter Head like Billy can ask for that kind of help. So don't go telling him we're coming to ya.

[E1B2_ARRV_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~Alrighty then, amigo. 

[E1J1_RAMP_01:E1J1AUD]
~z~Yo, I'm gonna drop these ramps.

[E1J1_AA_2:E1J1AUD]
~z~Hey, Johnny boy. You know the deal. 
[E1J1_AA_3:E1J1AUD]
~z~If it ain't one load of bullshit, it's a God damn n'other.
[E1J1_AA_4:E1J1AUD]
~z~Tell me about it. 
[E1J1_AA_5:E1J1AUD]
~z~I'm coming close to really losing my shit here.

~z~Well, you ain't gonna like what I'm about to do in the next few hours.
[E1J1_AA_7:E1J1AUD]
~z~What?
[E1J1_AA_8:E1J1AUD]
~z~We gotta go steal some bikes from the Angels of Death.
[E1J1_AA_9:E1J1AUD]
~z~Ain't we a little too old for stealing bikes and clubhouse flags and crap like that? 
[E1J1_AA_10:E1J1AUD]
~z~It don't help nothing. 
[E1J1_AA_11:E1J1AUD]
~z~Hey, I hear ya man. But these bikes are the real deal. 
[E1J1_AA_12:E1J1AUD]
~z~Now I got a guy who pays me for them 
[E1J1_AA_13:E1J1AUD]
~z~then he ships them over to Japan. 
[E1J1_AA_14:E1J1AUD]
~z~Apparently they're gonna go crazy for these bikes in particular. 
[E1J1_AA_15:E1J1AUD]
~z~Now business is business. 
[E1J1_AA_16:E1J1AUD]
~z~And the Angels, they're the Angels. 
[E1J1_AA_17:E1J1AUD]
~z~So do it for the memories.
[E1J1_AA_18:E1J1AUD]

[JF01_AC_9:E1J1AUD]
~z~These bikes are ours, Officer. 
[JF01_AC_10:E1J1AUD]
~z~Nobody's gonna be reporting these bikes stolen, so give us a break.
[JF01_AC_11:E1J1AUD]
~z~Ah, looks like these mopes have outsmarted us, don't it?
[JF01_AC_12:E1J1AUD]
~z~Unbelievable.

[JF01_AC_15:E1J1AUD]
~z~Yeah, funny.
[JF01_AC_16:E1J1AUD]
~z~You think you're smart? 
[JF01_AC_17:E1J1AUD]
~z~How smart you gonna feel when we drag your old lady downtown, 
[JF01_AC_18:E1J1AUD]
~z~turn the cameras off and interrogate her real hard?
[JF01_AC_19:E1J1AUD]
~z~I bet she'll love it. 
[JF01_AC_20:E1J1AUD]
~z~She'll be begging us for another fucking interrogation in no fucking time. 
[JF01_AC_21:E1J1AUD]
~z~Aww...

~z~Come on, man.

[E1J2_B1V1_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~I don't like people having a hold on me like this. People ask me why I dislike cops...
[E1J2_B1V1_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~I know, but they can't all be all bad.
[E1J2_B1V1_5:E1J2AUD]

~z~We don't want to piss 'em off too much. Not yet, at least. 
[E1J2_B2V1_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~Maybe you should have stolen his lunch money.
[E1J2_B2V1_6:E1J2AUD]
~z~Maybe you should be on the fucking stage with jokes like that. 

[E1J2_B2V2_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~That'll show 'em.
[E1J2_B2V2_3:E1J2AUD]

~z~Hey fatty, you can't fit on that bike. Why don't you pull over?
[E1J2_LOUDS_05:E1J2AUD]
~z~We're looking forward to kicking the shit out of you, mopes.
[E1J2_LOUDS_06:E1J2AUD]
~z~You're going to pay for that coffee and donut fat man.

[E1J2_CCAR1_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~... balls the size of mangoes.
[E1J2_CCAR1_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~You know what, I can't wait to get them down the precinct so we can really stomp on those fuckers.
[E1J2_CCAR1_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~Throw him in holding and let a pack of meatheads break them fucking potatoes for us.

[E1J2_CCAR2_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~ ... no, no, Mommy. Mommy, no.
[E1J2_CCAR2_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Mommy. Boo hoo hoo.
[E1J2_CCAR2_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~Mommy. He's crying like a little fucking bitch. Matthews you kill me you prick.

[E1J2_CCAR3_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~... three heads in the West River and not a body in sight.
[E1J2_CCAR3_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~No, no, no. It was the Humboldt. They found those left feet in the West River.
[E1J2_CCAR3_4:E1J2AUD]
~z~Fuck me sideways, you're right.

[E1J2_CCAR4_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~so I said, "But racial profiling works, motherfucker. Now give up the product."
[E1J2_CCAR4_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Ha, ha! Bet that shut him up.
[E1J2_CCAR4_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~Ha ha ha! Turned out to be a sociology professor at Vespucci University. 
[E1J2_CCAR4_7:E1J2AUD]
~z~Gave him the wrong badge number, thank God. Fucking dickhead!

[E1J2_CCAR5_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~... I.A.D. and the Sarge taking turns to screw me like it's my fucking quinceañera. 
[E1J2_CCAR5_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Always plant a gun, always. What did I tell you?
[E1J2_CCAR5_4:E1J2AUD]
~z~I know, I know, it's just there's only so many you can carry. Who'd think there'd be five of them.

[E1J2_CCAR6_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~Come on. I give up, alright, I give up. Come on, tell me.
[E1J2_CCAR6_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~A hooker being picked up by the chief on a Saturday night and let off with a special caution.
[E1J2_CCAR6_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~Ha! You are fucking killing me man. What'd you eat funny pills today or what?

[E1J2_ARR_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Here's where we end it.
[E1J2_ARR_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~This is where we deal with this bullshit.
[E1J2_ARR_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Here's as good a place as any.

[E1J2_BKUP_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~They're calling for backup, Johnny. Cut 'em off.
[E1J2_BKUP_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~We can't let 'em call for backup, Johnny boy. Close 'em down.
[E1J2_BKUP_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Johnny, they're calling in for reinforcements. Shut 'em up.

[E1J2_BKUP2_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Send in the wrecking crew, Sarge. We got a couple of bikers need to be taught a fucking lesson.
[E1J2_BKUP2_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~Hey Sarge, me and Matthews need a hand. Send out some boys who ain't afraid to break some fucking heads.
[E1J2_BKUP2_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Tell some of the boys to get their nightsticks out, Sarge. We got a couple of bikers need to be broken.

[E1J2_BKUP3_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Officer down. Officer down. We need fucking back up ten minutes ago!
[E1J2_BKUP3_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~Round up the boys. We got a cop killer on our hands! Man down! 
[E1J2_BKUP3_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Back up! Back up! Some perps have just got a hard on for killing cops. We got a man down! 

[E1J2_BKUPA_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Get your hands dirty, brothers!
[E1J2_BKUPA_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~Looks like you're outnumbered, friends!
[E1J2_BKUPA_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Welcome to the party, brothers!

[E1J2_LOST_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Is someone screwing with our brothers? Fuck you.
[E1J2_LOST_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~G.F.L.D. G.F.L.D.
[E1J2_LOST_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~The Lost forever, boys.
[E1J2_LOST_04:E1J2AUD]
~z~You shouldn't have played dirty, coppers.
[E1J2_LOST_05:E1J2AUD]
~z~Jim, Johnny, we're here for you brothers.

[E1J2_COPB_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Great, here come the rest of them.
[E1J2_COPB_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~And here are their buddies. Just great.
[E1J2_COPB_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~More of Liberty's least fine. Just what we need.

[E1J2_MCDEAD_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~McCornish - dammit. Bastard nearly had his twenty.
[E1J2_MCDEAD_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~You fucking mopes. McCornish was the best bad cop I knew.
[E1J2_MCDEAD_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~You're going to hell for that, shit head. 

[E1J2_FIGHTJ_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~You chose the wrong boys to put the squeeze on.
[E1J2_FIGHTJ_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~You pigs chose to play dirty, didn't you?
[E1J2_FIGHTJ_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~We ain't the pussies you thought we were.
[E1J2_FIGHTJ_04:E1J2AUD]
~z~No commemorative gold watch and nice little bribe for you, man.
[E1J2_FIGHTJ_05:E1J2AUD]
~z~Case fucking closed.
[E1J2_FIGHTJ_06:E1J2AUD]
~z~Fuck you very much.

[E1J2_FIGHTM_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~The rest of your fucking biker buddies are gonna pay for this, too. You fucking hump.
[E1J2_FIGHTM_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~We got the whole LCPD behind us, you fucking shit birds.
[E1J2_FIGHTM_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~You got no idea the shit storm that's going to come down on you, you fucking pricks.
[E1J2_FIGHTM_04:E1J2AUD]
~z~You guys are the dumbest fucking mopes I've ever seen in all of my years of service.

[E1J2_DROPC_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~What happened?
[E1J2_DROPC_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~We just couldn't take 'em out in the open like that. They're still cops. See you soon, man.

[E1J2_DROPB_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~Learn to tune your bike, man. Those cops are gonna be on us for good now. 
[E1J2_DROPB_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~There'll be another chance to deal with them. Don't you worry about that.

[E1J2_DROPE_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~Fuck me man, the whole LCPD are gonna be after us now. You can't just do that to a cop.
[E1J2_DROPE_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Yeah, I know man, I know. Look after yourself.

[E1J2_HOME_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~We got lucky there, Johnny boy. I thought we'd be shovelling shit for those dudes 'til God knows when.
[E1J2_HOME_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Now you know we ain't going out like that, Jim. I'll see you soon.

[E1J2_2CLOSE_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~They're right on us, Johnny.
[E1J2_2CLOSE_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~Johnny, man, they're right on top of us.
[E1J2_2CLOSE_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Brother, those cops have almost got us.
[E1J2_2CLOSE_04:E1J2AUD]
~z~Shit, Johnny. We're about to get fucked by those pigs.
[E1J2_2CLOSE_05:E1J2AUD]
~z~Hey, brother, this is about to get real unpleasant.

[E1J2_BACK_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Where the hell are you going, man?
[E1J2_BACK_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~You tryin' to get us killed?
[E1J2_BACK_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Get back on the bike, brother.
[E1J2_BACK_04:E1J2AUD]
~z~Get back here, Johnny.
[E1J2_BACK_05:E1J2AUD]
~z~Those cops are angry, man. Get back on the bike.

[E1J2_FALL_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Whoa, man. Easy.
[E1J2_FALL_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~What is wrong with you man?
[E1J2_FALL_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Think I ruptured something.
[E1J2_FALL_04:E1J2AUD]
~z~They're gonna get us.
[E1J2_FALL_05:E1J2AUD]
~z~Oh, Man. I'm getting to old for this shit.

[E1J2_FMATT_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Don't this badge mean nothing to you, fuck ups?
[E1J2_FMATT_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~I always thought you biker losers were moronic.
[E1J2_FMATT_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~We run this city, mopes. We are your Gods and we will crush you.
[E1J2_FMATT_04:E1J2AUD]
~z~This is the fucking end for all you Lost bikers. 

[E1J2_LOSE_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~We got to lose this heat, man.
[E1J2_LOSE_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~Hey man, can you shake this bacon?
[E1J2_LOSE_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Johnny man, we can't have the cops catching us now. Lose this heat.

[E1J2_DEAD_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~Alright then James, that's a few less dirty cops polluting this fine city.
[E1J2_DEAD_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Something tells me they weren't the only ones in the LCPD, Johnny. Back to the house, my man.

[E1J2_CH1_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~Man that shit was heavy. I feel bad for them bastards. Once upon a time, they must have wanted to do good. 
[E1J2_CH1_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~The second they shook us down for money, man, they came down to our level.
[E1J2_CH1_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~Worse; at least we ain't pretending to respect the law.
[E1J2_CH1_7:E1J2AUD]
~z~Yeah, dude, you're right.
[E1J2_CH1_9:E1J2AUD]
~z~A dirty cop's just like a Deadbeat or a Triad or any other crook in this town. 
[E1J2_CH1_11:E1J2AUD]
~z~Only they're just hypocrites as well.
[E1J2_CH1_13:E1J2AUD]
~z~Yeah, paying taxes and declaring incomes. And all the while taking the kickbacks.
[E1J2_CH1_15:E1J2AUD]
~z~Yeah, they spend the kickbacks on getting high and getting hole - just like the rest of us. 
[E1J2_CH1_17:E1J2AUD]
~z~They should get treated like the rest of us as well. Law of the streets.

[E1J2_CH2_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~How you feeling, Jim? Billy, man. I hope he handles his shit.
[E1J2_CH2_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Hey, Billy's Billy. They had him cooped up in that place for a while. He's just blowin' off some steam. 
[E1J2_CH2_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~Sure. How the hell did Billy managed to get off with rehab, anyway? 
[E1J2_CH2_6:E1J2AUD]
~z~Couple of therapy sessions and he's free as a bird?
[E1J2_CH2_8:E1J2AUD]
~z~I guess it's that lawyer he knows - Grossman. 
[E1J2_CH2_10:E1J2AUD]
~z~Yeah? Can't think of what I'd prefer, time in the joint or hanging with some sleazeball lawyer.
[E1J2_CH2_11:E1J2AUD]
~z~Man, I want the old Billy back, the one before the heroin. 

[E1J2_FALL2_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~You're getting too old for this, Johnny. 
[E1J2_FALL2_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~Maybe I should do the driving, man.
[E1J2_FALL2_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~You been drinking, Johnny? 

[E1J2_OFF_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Stop screwing around, Johnny.
[E1J2_OFF_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~We don't have time for this, man.
[E1J2_OFF_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~Come on, Johnny. What the fuck? 

[JF02_AA_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~Hey Jim, good to see ya man. 
[JF02_AA_2:E1J2AUD]
~z~What's the trouble?
[JF02_AA_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Take a guess, bro. 
[JF02_AA_4:E1J2AUD]
~z~It might have something to do with those cops that pulled one over on us. 
[JF02_AA_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~I figured.
[JF02_AA_6:E1J2AUD]
~z~The way I see it we got two choices. 
[JF02_AA_7:E1J2AUD]
~z~Either, we buy a big tub of grease 
[JF02_AA_8:E1J2AUD]
~z~and prepare to take it from these fat pigs for the rest of our lives.
[JF02_AA_9:E1J2AUD]
~z~Or?
[JF02_AA_10:E1J2AUD]
~z~Or, we head over to the clubhouse, 
[JF02_AA_11:E1J2AUD]
~z~close to where I happen to know they got themselves set up, 
[JF02_AA_12:E1J2AUD]
~z~and we show them that we're not quite the bitches they think we are.
[JF02_AA_13:E1J2AUD]
~z~Well, tempted as I am by your first option, I'm gonna have to go with the second.
[JF02_AA_14:E1J2AUD]
~z~I figured you'd say that. 
[JF02_AA_15:E1J2AUD]
~z~Lead on, James!

[JF02_BA_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~Wait here a minute. 
[JF02_BA_2:E1J2AUD]
~z~Hey, officers, how you doin?
[JF02_BA_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~Hey McCornish, this fat perp's brought us a present. 
[JF02_BA_4:E1J2AUD]
~z~You know, I forgot how stupid lookin' this guy was, Matthews. 
[JF02_BA_5:E1J2AUD]
~z~You think he's smart enough to realise that we got expensive tastes? 
[JF02_BA_6:E1J2AUD]
~z~What you got for us, mope? 
[JF02_BA_7:E1J2AUD]
~z~Ah, exactly what you asked for. 
[JF02_BA_8:E1J2AUD]
~z~There ya go! 
[JF02_BA_9:E1J2AUD]
~z~Come on, man. Get on!

[JF02_FAP_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~Nothing like the feel of a fully automatic pistol in your hand, you son of a bitch. 
[JF02_FAP_3:E1J2AUD]
~z~This is just like the old days.

[JF02_KILL_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~That's the last of them.
[JF02_KILL_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~So long, coppers. 
[JF02_KILL_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~That was easier than paying a bribe. 

[JF02_CHASE_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Don't let 'em catch you now, Jim.
[JF02_CHASE_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~Stupid pigs.
[JF02_CHASE_03:E1J2AUD]
~z~The bulls are seeing red.
[JF02_CHASE_04:E1J2AUD]
~z~Poor assholes don't know what they're in for.
[JF02_CHASE_05:E1J2AUD]
~z~It's nearly retirement time, fuckers.
[JF02_CHASE_06:E1J2AUD]
~z~I'm gonna go undercover in your asses, dickheads.
[JF02_CHASE_07:E1J2AUD]
~z~Write me a speeding ticket.
[JF02_CHASE_08:E1J2AUD]
~z~Time's almost up, you dirty bastards. 

[JF02_RACE_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~How bout we race over to those fucking dirty cops, old man? Think you can handle it?
[JF02_RACE_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~Let's see if you still got it, old man. Let's drop the fuckin' hammer on this run to those assholes.

[JF02_JWIN_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Shit, Jim, you should think about retiring with moves like that.
[JF02_JWIN_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~How do I look from behind, man? You like looking at my patch?

[JF02_JLOSE_01:E1J2AUD]
~z~Age before beauty, my man. Age before beauty. 
[JF02_JLOSE_02:E1J2AUD]
~z~You still know a few tricks, old man. I'll give you that.

[E1J2_DROPX_1:E1J2AUD]
~z~There'll be another chance to deal with them. Don't you worry about that.


{E1J3}

[E1J3_RACE_01:E1J3AUD]
~z~Hey, Angus. Know any bikes that need to be liberated from their owners?
[E1J3_RACE_02:E1J3AUD]
~z~Angus, I got a feeling there might be a bike you're looking for.
[E1J3_RACE_03:E1J3AUD]
~z~Angus, brother. If you were going to export a bike to Japan, where might I be able to find it?
[E1J3_RACE_04:E1J3AUD]
~z~Brother man, tell me where I can find a bike and I'll bring it right to you.
[E1J3_RACE_05:E1J3AUD]
~z~Shit, Angus, I'm in the bike stealing mood. Where am I gonna be able to find one?
[E1J3_RACE_06:E1J3AUD]
~z~There's too many assholes in this city on bikes, my man. Which one can I deprive of his ride?
[E1J3_RACE_07:E1J3AUD]
~z~Tell me where I can find a bike and it's yours, Angus.

[E1J3_RESP_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~Johnny boy. This import export guy - he's got a long shopping list.
[E1J3_RESP_3:E1J3AUD]
~z~ I'm glad we got you to do the acquiring.

[E1J3_NONE_01:E1J3AUD]
~z~There's nothing available right now, Johnny. Call back soon and we'll see if we can find one.
[E1J3_NONE_02:E1J3AUD]
~z~Johnny, man. We haven't been able to source any. It's only a matter of time though so call back.
[E1J3_NONE_03:E1J3AUD]
~z~How about that, man. We haven't been able to find what we need. Call again soon and they'll be one.
[E1J3_NONE_04:E1J3AUD]
~z~Nothing right now, man. Sorry. Call back, okay?

[E1J3_FAILD_01:E1J3AUD]
~z~We've got one for you, old friend. Just try to save me the hassle and deliver it this time.
[E1J3_FAILD_02:E1J3AUD]
~z~I've got something, Johnny. Please, for me, can you make sure it gets here?
[E1J3_FAILD_03:E1J3AUD]
~z~We got one, man. This guy gets mad when they're not delivered, but fuck him, man, you're my brother.
[E1J3_FAILD_04:E1J3AUD]
~z~Well, you didn't get the last one, but who cares, right? There's another one lined up for you.

[E1J3_GOOD_01:E1J3AUD]
~z~That last one's in the container heading east and we've lined up another.
[E1J3_GOOD_02:E1J3AUD]
~z~The guy's happy with the last one and he's hungry for another, man.
[E1J3_GOOD_03:E1J3AUD]
~z~After delivering like you did before, this dude is happy to be in business with us, man.
[E1J3_GOOD_04:E1J3AUD]
~z~How about that? You just keep knocking 'em out. And you know what? We got another bike lined up.

[E1J3_DROP1_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~It's outside the Triangle Club in Bohan. Just bring it back to the House, OK?

[E1J3_DROP2_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~Some Deadbeats left it outside that liquor store on Dillon Street.

[E1J3_DROP3_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~There's a guy detailing it like he knows it's for sale or something. Outside the tattoo guy in Alderney City.

[E1J3_DROP4_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~It's in that multi-storey car park in Purgatory.

[E1J3_DROP5_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~They got it outside that showroom on Percell in Westdyke.

[E1J3_DROP6_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~Assholes don't know how much it's worth. They're screwing it up on the beach at Firefly.

[E1J3_DROP7_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~I hate to split up a pair of lovebirds, but there's a couple taking it for a spin round Middle Park.

[E1J3_DROP8_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~Some Deadbeats are taking it over the East Borough Bridge.

[E1J3_DROP9_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~Big group of Deadbeats are taking it for a run down the old Alderney freeway.

[E1J3_DROP10_1:E1J3AUD]
~z~Guy's riding it round Chinatown.

[E1J3_COOL_01:E1J3AUD]
~z~On it.
[E1J3_COOL_02:E1J3AUD]
~z~It's yours.
[E1J3_COOL_03:E1J3AUD]
~z~Good as done.
[E1J3_COOL_04:E1J3AUD]
~z~Heading there now.
[E1J3_COOL_05:E1J3AUD]
~z~Let's do this.
[E1J3_COOL_06:E1J3AUD]
~z~Let's get this done.
[E1J3_COOL_07:E1J3AUD]
~z~Rock and roll.
[E1J3_COOL_08:E1J3AUD]
~z~Fuck it, we're on.
[E1J3_COOL_09:E1J3AUD]
~z~Cool.
[E1J3_COOL_10:E1J3AUD]
~z~All good.

[E1J3_PASS_01:E1J3AUD]
~z~Alright, man. Your dude's got his bike.
[E1J3_PASS_02:E1J3AUD]
~z~The bike's all parked up and waiting, man.
[E1J3_PASS_03:E1J3AUD]
~z~Hey, your contact better still want that bike 'cause I got it for him.
[E1J3_PASS_04:E1J3AUD]
~z~The bike's there, man. The bike's fucking there.
[E1J3_PASS_05:E1J3AUD]
~z~Bike's outside the house where you wanted it, man.
[E1J3_PASS_06:E1J3AUD]
~z~The bike's right there for you, brother. No problem. 
[E1J3_PASS_07:E1J3AUD]
~z~Angus, man, you and your contact are now the proud owners of a second hand bike.
[E1J3_PASS_08:E1J3AUD]
~z~Bike's outside of the clubhouse, now all you need to do is get it out the country, Angus.

[E1J3_FAIL_01:E1J3AUD]
~z~Angus, man, I'm sorry but shit got fucked up and I couldn't get that bike.
[E1J3_FAIL_02:E1J3AUD]
~z~Hey dude, your man isn't going to get his ride. Let him down easy.
[E1J3_FAIL_03:E1J3AUD]
~z~Too bad, brother, but that guy won't be getting his hands on that bike today.
[E1J3_FAIL_04:E1J3AUD]

[E1J4_CPASS_9:E1J4AUD]
~z~Give Terry or Clay a call if you ever need some help on club business.

~z~What'd you say to 'em?
[E1J5_B1V2_5:E1J5AUD]

[E1J5_B1V2_7:E1J5AUD]
~z~That much I do know.

[E1J5_B2V1_1:E1J5AUD]
~z~These are tough times. How's Jackie feel about what's going down?
[E1J5_B2V1_3:E1J5AUD]
~z~She just doesn't want to see the kid grow up without a father. 
[E1J5_B2V1_5:E1J5AUD]
~z~None of us do, James. Don't worry about that. 

[E1J5_B2V2_1:E1J5AUD]

[E1J5_DROP_3:E1J5AUD]
~z~Don't apologize, Johnny. Brian's the one with something to be sorry for. Another time.

[E1J5_BACK_1:E1J5AUD]
~z~Looks like we're about all that's left of the Alderney chapter, man.
[E1J5_BACK_3:E1J5AUD]

~z~Hey, what's the plan?
[JF05_AA_5:E1J5AUD]
~z~We spoke to that fat fuck Brian. He wants to sit down, call a truce.
[JF05_AA_6:E1J5AUD]
~z~Brian wants a truce? 
[JF05_AA_7:E1J5AUD]
~z~Fuck that, let's go get him.

[JF05_BA_2:E1J5AUD]
~z~Billy was always good to you and you ratted him out.

[JF05_BA_7:E1J5AUD]
~z~"You're dumber than I thought, you're dumber than I thought."
[JF05_BA_8:E1J5AUD]
~z~I knew you'd say that, just knew you'd say that. 
[JF05_BA_9:E1J5AUD]
~z~You're so predictable, Johnny Little-dick-o-witz. 
[JF05_BA_10:E1J5AUD]

[E1B6_LIVE_01:E1J6AUD]
~z~I couldn't do it to a brother, even him. He's dead inside anyway.
[E1B6_LIVE_02:E1J6AUD]
~z~That guy was too pathetic to kill. He's already dead anyway.

[E1B6_CALL1_1:E1J6AUD]
~z~What happened, Johnny?
[E1B6_CALL1_3:E1J6AUD]
~z~The little bastard slipped through my fingers, man.

[E1B6_CALL2_3:E1J6AUD]
~z~James, I couldn't do it, man. He getting out of town. 
[E1B6_CALL2_5:E1J6AUD]
~z~It's hard to kill a man when he isn't behaving like one.
[E1B6_CALL2_7:E1J6AUD]
~z~I know what you mean. Let's just hope he's not planning anything else. Later on, man.

[E1B6_CALL3_1:E1J6AUD]
~z~Jonathan, where's Brian?
[E1B6_CALL3_3:E1J6AUD]
~z~Halfway to Hell, my brother.

[E1B6_CLAY_1:E1J6AUD]
~z~What's up?
[E1B6_CLAY_3:E1J6AUD]
~z~I was just thinking how selfish it was of me to deal with Brian all by myself. 
[E1B6_CLAY_4:E1J6AUD]
~z~You want a piece of the action?
[E1B6_CLAY_6:E1J6AUD]
~z~Damn right I do.

[E1B6_TERRY_1:E1J6AUD]
~z~Johnny, man. 
[E1B6_TERRY_3:E1J6AUD]

~z~You want to pay Brian a visit with me?
[E1B6_TERRY_7:E1J6AUD]

~z~Clay, I'm at Brian's place. You guys want to come here and help me with him?
[E1B6_CLAY2_5:E1J6AUD]
~z~Right on, Brother. Me and Terry can go 'round the back and wait for him.
[E1B6_CLAY2_7:E1J6AUD]
~z~If you send a grenade in the window, that should smoke him right out to us.
[E1B6_CLAY2_9:E1J6AUD]
~z~Sounds good.

[E1B6_TERRY2_1:E1J6AUD]
~z~How's my brother, Brian? 
[E1B6_TERRY2_3:E1J6AUD]

[E1B6_TERRY2_6:E1J6AUD]
~z~Alright, man, alright. We can wait out back for him.
[E1B6_TERRY2_7:E1J6AUD]
~z~All you got to do is scare him out here into our arms. Can you do that?
[E1B6_TERRY2_9:E1J6AUD]
~z~Let's see.

[E1B6_BACK_01:E1J6AUD]
~z~We're gonna go 'round back, flush him out. Yeah?
[E1B6_BACK_02:E1J6AUD]
~z~Me and Clay gonna go 'round back. Smoke out Brian.

[E1B6_OUT_01:E1J6AUD]
~z~We're gonna wait out here man. Don't worry about Brian escaping.
[E1B6_OUT_02:E1J6AUD]
~z~Alright me and Clay will keep anyone from getting out of here.
[E1B6_OUT_03:E1J6AUD]
~z~Get in there, Johnny. Me and Clay'll keep the entrance covered.

[E1B6_GREN_01:E1J6AUD]
~z~Why don't you put a grenade through that window, man?
[E1B6_GREN_02:E1J6AUD]
~z~See how Brian likes you sending a bomb through that there window, brother.
[E1B6_GREN_03:E1J6AUD]
~z~I'd pay a dollar to see Brian's face if you shot a grenade through that window, man.

[E1B6_WRECK_1:E1J6AUD]
~z~Johnny. What happened?
[E1B6_WRECK_3:E1J6AUD]

{Assassination}

[E1S1_CALL1_1:E1S1AUD]
~z~Stubbs.
[E1S1_CALL1_3:E1S1AUD]
~z~Klebitz. I thought you should know my Uncle's exact movements. 
[E1S1_CALL1_5:E1S1AUD]
~z~He's coming into Francis International from his estate in South Carraway in the family helicopter. 
[E1S1_CALL1_7:E1S1AUD]
~z~He'll land and travel in a car convoy to the Civic Citadel. 
[E1S1_CALL1_9:E1S1AUD]
~z~I'm guessing you don't want me to hurt the precious family chopper. 
[E1S1_CALL1_10:E1S1AUD]
~z~Don't worry about that. We've got terrorism insurance up to our eye balls.
[E1S1_CALL1_12:E1S1AUD]
~z~Life insurance too, for that matter. Oh no, you take out my dearest kin any way you can.
[E1S1_CALL1_14:E1S1AUD]
~z~You know, you're really starting to grow on me.
[E1S1_CALL1_16:E1S1AUD]
~z~Oh, don't get sentimental, Klebitz. It's unappealing. I am a WASP, after all.

[E1S1_HELP_1:E1S1AUD]
~z~Ah, Mr. Klebitz, in need of some help, are we?
[E1S1_HELP_3:E1S1AUD]
~z~Yeah, I guess I am. 
[E1S1_HELP_5:E1S1AUD]
~z~Alright, I'll make the call. There's going to be a car for you in short term parking. 
[E1S1_HELP_7:E1S1AUD]
~z~It'll have a baggage handler uniform in it that should get you access to the runways. Enjoy yourself.
[E1S1_HELP_9:E1S1AUD]
~z~You too.

[E1S1_CLOSE_01:E1S1AUD]
~z~Please step back or we will consider you a terrorist.
[E1S1_CLOSE_02:E1S1AUD]
~z~You don't racially profile like a terrorist, but I'm about to start treating you like one.
[E1S1_CLOSE_03:E1S1AUD]
~z~If you're looking to board a plane, you're in the wrong place.
[E1S1_CLOSE_04:E1S1AUD]
~z~Take a step back, buddy. This is off limits to you.
[E1S1_CLOSE_05:E1S1AUD]
~z~We're trying to protect people over here, take a step back.

[E1S1_PASSG_01:E1S1AUD]
~z~Alright there, trooper.
[E1S1_PASSG_02:E1S1AUD]
~z~Remember to lift with your knees.
[E1S1_PASSG_03:E1S1AUD]
~z~Don't lose any bags today, alright.
[E1S1_PASSG_04:E1S1AUD]
~z~If you see any suspicious packages, let me know.
[E1S1_PASSG_05:E1S1AUD]
~z~Enjoy making minimum wage, asshole.

[E1S1_2CLOSE_01:E1S1AUD]
~z~Watch it, buddy. There ain't no heavy lifting needed over here.
[E1S1_2CLOSE_02:E1S1AUD]
~z~Don't you have any bags to rifle through or something. Get lost.
[E1S1_2CLOSE_03:E1S1AUD]
~z~Nice tattoos, no wonder you can only get a job like this. Move it, asshole.
[E1S1_2CLOSE_04:E1S1AUD]
~z~This ain't any of your business, bag monkey. Clear off.
[E1S1_2CLOSE_05:E1S1AUD]
~z~We're looking after a VIP and he doesn't wanna see your ugly face. So long. 

[E1S1_COMBAT_01:E1S1AUD]
~z~This guy ain't right, drop him.
[E1S1_COMBAT_02:E1S1AUD]
~z~Protect Mr. Stubbs.
[E1S1_COMBAT_03:E1S1AUD]
~z~We got a problem here. 
[E1S1_COMBAT_04:E1S1AUD]
~z~This asshole just gave us permission to use deadly force, people.
[E1S1_COMBAT_05:E1S1AUD]
~z~Take this prick down, people.

[E1S1_CALLS_1:E1S1AUD]
~z~I've just sent my black suit to the dry cleaners. You better have the news I'm looking for.
[E1S1_CALLS_3:E1S1AUD]
~z~I'm afraid not, Stubbs. Your uncle is alive and well. 
[E1S1_CALLS_5:E1S1AUD]
~z~You better start looking for another source of campaign financing.

[E1S1_HELP2_1:E1S1AUD]
~z~Okay, Klebitz. Give me the good news.
[E1S1_HELP2_3:E1S1AUD]
~z~I'm just about happy with the eulogy my researchers drafted up.
[E1S1_HELP2_5:E1S1AUD]
~z~Sadly, Stubbs, I'm not going to be able to disappoint you. Your uncle is no longer with us.
[E1S1_HELP2_7:E1S1AUD]
~z~For my conscience's sake, I hope your lack of humanity is a genetic quality.
[E1S1_HELP2_9:E1S1AUD]
~z~Ah, he was a man of the people, a philanthropist, a pompous windbag and an occasional catamite,
[E1S1_HELP2_11:E1S1AUD]
~z~a typical Stubbs you might say. Sleep easy and drop into the club sometime soon.

[E1S1_AA_1:E1S1AUD]
~z~Do you have an appointment?
[E1S1_AA_2:E1S1AUD]
~z~Uhh... no I thought I'd inquire about a membership.
[E1S1_AA_3:E1S1AUD]
~z~Excuse me?
[E1S1_AA_4:E1S1AUD]
~z~Yeah, under this ravaged, drug-addled exterior lies the heart of a reactionary prick,
[E1S1_AA_5:E1S1AUD]
~z~so I thought I'd fit right in here.
[E1S1_AA_6:E1S1AUD]
~z~I think you should leave, sir, before I call the police. 
[E1S1_AA_7:E1S1AUD]
~z~"I think you should leave sir, before I...", dude, it is the twenty-first century. 
[E1S1_AA_8:E1S1AUD]
~z~Let me tell you something... you've got a job wiping rich pricks' asses, 
[E1S1_AA_9:E1S1AUD]
~z~and for some reason you seem a little pleased with yourself.
[E1S1_AA_10:E1S1AUD]
~z~Will you leave?
[E1S1_AA_11:E1S1AUD]
~z~Trust me man, nothing would please me more, 
[E1S1_AA_12:E1S1AUD]
~z~but I'm supposed to see Tom Stubbs and well... he said to meet him here. 
[E1S1_AA_13:E1S1AUD]
~z~Oh, Mr. Stubbs, sir. Okay, you only had to say so, sir. 
[E1S1_AA_14:E1S1AUD]
~z~Follow me, will you. Mr. Stubbs is in the day spa, receiving some back work.
[E1S1_AA_15:E1S1AUD]
~z~Right you are. 
[E1S1_AA_16:E1S1AUD]
~z~Mr. Stubbs. A gentleman for you.
[E1S1_AA_17:E1S1AUD]
~z~Thank you, Leavis. 
[E1S1_AA_18:E1S1AUD]
~z~And thank you. 
[E1S1_AA_19:E1S1AUD]
~z~So, you're David Grossman's friend?
[E1S1_AA_20:E1S1AUD]
~z~Oh yeah, we're old, old buddies. 
[E1S1_AA_21:E1S1AUD]
~z~Love the old boy network. 
[E1S1_AA_22:E1S1AUD]
~z~Yeah, I can imagine. So what is it that you want?
[E1S1_AA_23:E1S1AUD]
~z~-Could you excuse us, sugar?~n~-Okay, sure.
[E1S1_AA_24:E1S1AUD]
~z~And thank you, best massage I ever had that didn't involve a happy ending 
[E1S1_AA_25:E1S1AUD]
~z~or a poignant sense of guilt afterwards.
[E1S1_AA_26:E1S1AUD]
~z~See you tomorrow.
[E1S1_AA_27:E1S1AUD]
~z~Tom Stubbs. How do you do?
[E1S1_AA_28:E1S1AUD]
~z~Well, now that you mention it... I'm starting to feel a little queasy.
[E1S1_AA_29:E1S1AUD]
~z~Don't be pathetic and no secrets here, pal. 
[E1S1_AA_30:E1S1AUD]
~z~Now listen. I'm in a bit of a bother, sport.
[E1S1_AA_31:E1S1AUD]
~z~Well I think they can fix that with surgery these days, you know.
[E1S1_AA_32:E1S1AUD]
~z~Can we stop with the jokes? 
[E1S1_AA_33:E1S1AUD]
~z~Grossman tells me you're reliable.
[E1S1_AA_34:E1S1AUD]
~z~Grossman? That guys an asshole.
[E1S1_AA_35:E1S1AUD]
~z~Look, I'm not going to insult your intelligence by pretending to be a good guy.
[E1S1_AA_36:E1S1AUD]
~z~I'm a politician. I'm a cynic. I'm very needy.
[E1S1_AA_37:E1S1AUD]
~z~I need people to like me. I need people to like me so that they elect me.
[E1S1_AA_38:E1S1AUD]
~z~I need people to elect me so that I feel marginally less bad about myself 
[E1S1_AA_39:E1S1AUD]
~z~when I stare into the mirror.
[E1S1_AA_40:E1S1AUD]
~z~That being said, I try to do a good deed here and there. 
[E1S1_AA_41:E1S1AUD]
~z~Democracy's a beautiful thing. 
[E1S1_AA_42:E1S1AUD]
~z~Personally, I'd prefer a benign dictatorship without the pretence of choice, 
[E1S1_AA_43:E1S1AUD]
~z~but let's leave the political discussions shall we?
[E1S1_AA_44:E1S1AUD]
~z~Yes, let's.
[E1S1_AA_45:E1S1AUD]
~z~Unfortunately, an awful man has insured that my chance of being re-elected is pretty much zero. 
[E1S1_AA_46:E1S1AUD]
~z~Why? Blackmail?
[E1S1_AA_47:E1S1AUD]
~z~Not exactly. I need his money, and he hasn't died.
[E1S1_AA_48:E1S1AUD]
~z~What? You want me to kill your father?
[E1S1_AA_49:E1S1AUD]
~z~No. That's disgusting. How could you suggest such a thing?
[E1S1_AA_50:E1S1AUD]
~z~My father died years ago, thank god. No. My uncle. 
[E1S1_AA_51:E1S1AUD]
~z~That sanctimonious do-gooder controls the family trust. 
[E1S1_AA_52:E1S1AUD]
~z~Whoa, that's heavy man.
[E1S1_AA_53:E1S1AUD]
~z~Yes, so is being arrested for drug running and spending the next thirty years in prison. 
[E1S1_AA_54:E1S1AUD]
~z~You and your little gang, I mean.
[E1S1_AA_55:E1S1AUD]
~z~I see, you make a wonderful politician. 
[E1S1_AA_56:E1S1AUD]
~z~I know . Now, you've got to get the old goat today.
[E1S1_AA_57:E1S1AUD]
~z~Make it spectacular.
[E1S1_AA_58:E1S1AUD]
~z~Make it appear as though it's a terrorist act. 
[E1S1_AA_59:E1S1AUD]
~z~That'll do wonders for my campaign in all sorts of ways. 
[E1S1_AA_60:E1S1AUD]
~z~Leavis will give you a package on the way out. 
[E1S1_AA_61:E1S1AUD]
~z~Oh and Klebitz, trust me...
[E1S1_AA_62:E1S1AUD]
~z~I am what I am, but I look out for those who help me.
[E1S1_AA_63:E1S1AUD]
~z~A blackmailer with a conscience, beautiful.

[E1S1_TA_01:E1S1AUD]
~z~Thanks, man.
[E1S1_TA_02:E1S1AUD]
~z~Much appreciated. 
[E1S1_TA_03:E1S1AUD]
~z~Mucho gusto.

[E1S2_APP_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~You're going to need to step away from the building, sir.
[E1S2_APP_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~Please, sir. We cannot have civilians approaching the station house today.
[E1S2_APP_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~Please stand back, sir. It's for you own safety.
[E1S2_APP_04:E1S2AUD]
~z~There are some bad people in here, sir. Please stand back.
[E1S2_APP_05:E1S2AUD]
~z~The only people coming past here today are wearing cuffs. Walk away.

[E1S2_PAST_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~We are now authorised to use force.
[E1S2_PAST_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~You crossed the line.
[E1S2_PAST_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~You're in my world now, son.
[E1S2_PAST_04:E1S2AUD]
~z~Drop this perp.
[E1S2_PAST_05:E1S2AUD]
~z~We got an intruder.

[E1S2_CCAR_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~Come right in, buddy.
[E1S2_CCAR_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~True blue. Come on in.
[E1S2_CCAR_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~Get in here, buddy. 

[E1S2_BUS_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~There's been a change of destination for you fellas.
[E1S2_BUS_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~I'm afraid you boys aren't gonna start your stretch yet.
[E1S2_BUS_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~This bus ain't going to Alderney State Correctional I'm afraid.

[E1S2_TOGO_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~There's a boat waiting behind the Globe Oil plant in Acter Industrial.
[E1S2_TOGO_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~The rendezvous is by the Globe Oil plant in the Acter Industrial Park.
[E1S2_TOGO_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~Acter Industrial is where they're meant to meet us. By the Globe Oil plant. 

[E1S2_CALM_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~I'm trying to save your preppie asses, so calm down.
[E1S2_CALM_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~Can you keep it down? In case you ain't noticed I'm trying to keep you boys outta prison.
[E1S2_CALM_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~Unless you yuppies want me to throw you to the pigs, shut the hell up.
[E1S2_CALM_04:E1S2AUD]
~z~Shut it, yuppies. I'm trying to think.
[E1S2_CALM_05:E1S2AUD]
~z~Hey, my preppie friends, will you shut the hell up?

[E1S2_CALLJ_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~Jonathan, what's the problem?
[E1S2_CALLJ_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~I need some help, brother. The cherry tops have got me closed in. I need some friends to take some of the heat for me.
[E1S2_CALLJ_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~Anything for a brother in need. I'll tell them to listen out for the sirens. Good luck with it.

[E1S2_BIKERS_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~Good to see you, boys.
[E1S2_BIKERS_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~Thanks for joining the party, brothers.
[E1S2_BIKERS_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~Have at 'em, brothers. Great to see ya.

[E1S2_STUBBS_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~Well, Mr. Stubbs. The good news is the cops aren't going to get there hands on those voters. 
[E1S2_STUBBS_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~The bad news is they're dead.
[E1S2_STUBBS_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~Dead men don't talk, Klebitz. This, I can work with. I'll talk to you soon.

[E1S2_CALLS_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~I'm afraid I can't get your yuppie friends out of the city, Mr. Stubbs.
[E1S2_CALLS_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~If you've got any strings left to pull, I'd pull 'em now.
[E1S2_CALLS_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~Every wise politician knows when to cut their losses. 
[E1S2_CALLS_7:E1S2AUD]
~z~My former friends are on their own now. I'll see you, Klebitz.

[E1S2_BOAT_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~You should be put down. I saw what you did to that orderly. 
[E1S2_BOAT_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~A man's organs ain't meant to look like that. Come on.

[E1S2_CHATV1_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~So, umm, what're you folks in for?
[E1S2_CHATV1_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~For these fellas it's white collar shenanigans. Caught with their hand in the cookie jar. 
[E1S2_CHATV1_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~My greed was of a... more corporeal nature.
[E1S2_CHATV1_7:E1S2AUD]
~z~I'm gonna take that as meaning you were into some sick shit. Let's not discuss it. 
[E1S2_CHATV1_9:E1S2AUD]
~z~As you wish, dear boy. 
[E1S2_CHATV1_11:E1S2AUD]
~z~I'm guessing it wasn't you I got paid to bail out anyways. 
[E1S2_CHATV1_13:E1S2AUD]
~z~I doubt those who remember me think it a great idea that I am about to be roaming free again. 
[E1S2_CHATV1_15:E1S2AUD]
~z~Okey dokey then. 

[E1S2_CHATV2_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~So, you're a motorcyclist? What hardware do you grip between those thighs? 
[E1S2_CHATV2_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~A panhead, shovelhead, V-twin?
[E1S2_CHATV2_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~You a bike man?
[E1S2_CHATV2_7:E1S2AUD]
~z~I'm familiar with mechanics. I believe it's man's duty to take things apart and see how they work. 
[E1S2_CHATV2_9:E1S2AUD]
~z~Sure.
[E1S2_CHATV2_11:E1S2AUD]
~z~You learn so much from seeing the insides of things.
[E1S2_CHATV2_13:E1S2AUD]
~z~Cars, bikes... we are all machines.
[E1S2_CHATV2_15:E1S2AUD]
~z~You got real problems, brother.
[E1S2_CHATV2_17:E1S2AUD]
~z~And everything in your garden is rosey. How nice! 
[E1S2_CHATV2_19:E1S2AUD]
~z~I wager one could learn a lot about my fellow prisoners by seeing how they're wired.
[E1S2_CHATV2_21:E1S2AUD]
~z~Learn all you like, just wait until I'm paid, mister.

[E1S2_DOCKS_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~Thank you, sir. My fellow prisoners and I are most grateful.
[E1S2_DOCKS_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~We've got a boat to catch.
[E1S2_DOCKS_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~Oh, I do like to be beside the seaside. 
[E1S2_DOCKS_7:E1S2AUD]
~z~Oh, I do like to be beside the sea.
[E1S2_DOCKS_9:E1S2AUD]
~z~Oh, I do like to walk along the prom, prom, prom. Where the brass bands play fidaly bum, bum, bum, bum.
[E1S2_DOCKS_11:E1S2AUD]
~z~Bon voyage.

[E1S2_ONBUS_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~Those coveralls chafing you? Well you must be used to wearing Perseus suits and shit.
[E1S2_ONBUS_2:E1S2AUD]
~z~Look, it was a victimless crime. My taxes pay your salary.
[E1S2_ONBUS_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~Long way from the Exchange now, aren't you, you yuppie pricks? Still think you're better than guys like me, huh?

[E1S2_FREE2_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~Your friends are out to sea, Mr. Stubbs. Good luck to them. I think they'll need it.
[E1S2_FREE2_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~Oh don't you worry, those boys don't need luck. You shoulda seen them in '73.
[E1S2_FREE2_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~Believe me, a short recession and a trip to Panama isn't going to finish those boys off. 
[E1S2_FREE2_7:E1S2AUD]
~z~All traders by blood. Great genes.
[E1S2_FREE2_9:E1S2AUD]
~z~I was thinking their problem might lie with one of the other passengers on their little cruise. Later on, Mr. Congressman.

[E1S2_BLOC_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~We got a roadblock, people. Things might get a little rough.
[E1S2_BLOC_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~LCPD done setup a roadblock. They want your asses bad, boys!
[E1S2_BLOC_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~One police roadblock coming up. Strap in!

[E1S2_CON_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~It's a Deadbeat turkey shoot.
[E1S2_CON_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~I hope them Deadbeats're enjoying their run.
[E1S2_CON_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~Don't think you ain't gettin' caught in this thing, Deadbeats.

[E1S2_LOAD2_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~Cops'll be lookin' for this bus. You better ditch it. 

[E1S2_BA_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~Whoa.
[E1S2_BA_2:E1S2AUD]
~z~You're the best tasting thing I've had since I got locked up.
[E1S2_BA_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~That's intense. 
[E1S2_BA_4:E1S2AUD]
~z~Alright! 
[E1S2_BA_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~Since we've all, uh, eaten, 
[E1S2_BA_6:E1S2AUD]
~z~we've got a new destination people. 

[E1S2_AA_1:E1S2AUD]
~z~Ahh, Mr. Stubbs is expecting you.
[E1S2_AA_2:E1S2AUD]
~z~Hey, how ya doing man?
[E1S2_AA_3:E1S2AUD]
~z~Oh yes, sir. Hello, sir. I'm fine.
[E1S2_AA_4:E1S2AUD]
~z~Good. Hey let me ask you something... 
[E1S2_AA_5:E1S2AUD]
~z~do you really enjoy life?
[E1S2_AA_6:E1S2AUD]
~z~I don't really know what you mean, sir.
[E1S2_AA_7:E1S2AUD]
~z~I mean, does serving all these rich morons, you know...
[E1S2_AA_8:E1S2AUD]
~z~smell of money and all that stuff, you know, does that make you happy?
[E1S2_AA_9:E1S2AUD]
~z~Yes, sir. Something like that. And tell me sir, are you happy?
[E1S2_AA_10:E1S2AUD]
~z~I mean, has giving the man, the, err, finger, 
[E1S2_AA_11:E1S2AUD]
~z~really satisfied some inner urge within you, sir?
[E1S2_AA_12:E1S2AUD]
~z~Well, I think what I've learned is that there's always a man, dude.
[E1S2_AA_13:E1S2AUD]
~z~He just wears a different uniform.
[E1S2_AA_14:E1S2AUD]
~z~As you say, sir.
[E1S2_AA_15:E1S2AUD]
~z~Ah, Mr. Stubbs is in the steam room. Right this way.
[E1S2_AA_16:E1S2AUD]
~z~Klebitz! How ya doing, sport?
[E1S2_AA_17:E1S2AUD]
~z~Hey. 
[E1S2_AA_18:E1S2AUD]
~z~I'm fully clothed, in a steam room with a murdering politician, 
[E1S2_AA_19:E1S2AUD]
~z~while my whole life falls to shit all around me. But fuck it. I'm alright. 
[E1S2_AA_20:E1S2AUD]
~z~Miss your uncle?
[E1S2_AA_21:E1S2AUD]
~z~Oh, I've doubled up on the therapy.
[E1S2_AA_22:E1S2AUD]
~z~Change your therapist. 
[E1S2_AA_23:E1S2AUD]
~z~Oh, but I've been seeing Dr. White since I was seven. 
[E1S2_AA_24:E1S2AUD]
~z~The man's a genius.
[E1S2_AA_25:E1S2AUD]
~z~Okay. What can I do for you man? 
[E1S2_AA_26:E1S2AUD]
~z~I'm not really dressed for this and you said it was urgent.
[E1S2_AA_27:E1S2AUD]
~z~Yes, well, there's been a clerical error 
[E1S2_AA_28:E1S2AUD]
~z~down in the deepest recesses of the Civic Citadel. 
[E1S2_AA_29:E1S2AUD]
~z~A group of outstanding civilians, 
[E1S2_AA_30:E1S2AUD]
~z~voters, have mistakenly been taken into LCPD custody. 
[E1S2_AA_31:E1S2AUD]
~z~Well, isn't there something you can do about that yourself man?
[E1S2_AA_32:E1S2AUD]
~z~Pull some strings or something?
[E1S2_AA_33:E1S2AUD]
~z~No, I'm afraid not sport, way too far down the line for that. 
[E1S2_AA_34:E1S2AUD]
~z~Too much red tape, yadda yadda yadda... 
[E1S2_AA_35:E1S2AUD]
~z~No, all you need to know is that, uh, 
[E1S2_AA_36:E1S2AUD]
~z~these gentlemen are in a prison transport bus,
[E1S2_AA_37:E1S2AUD]
~z~and you, my friend, need to liberate them.
[E1S2_AA_38:E1S2AUD]
~z~Sure, I got it.
[E1S2_AA_39:E1S2AUD]
~z~The bus is at the Leftwood Police Station.
[E1S2_AA_40:E1S2AUD]
~z~Get them out of there and we will make it worth your while.
[E1S2_AA_41:E1S2AUD]
~z~Ok, I got it.
[E1S2_AA_42:E1S2AUD]
~z~Don't sweat it Klebitz.

[E1S2_QUIP_01:E1S2AUD]
~z~Mom always told me I'd be a bus driver.
[E1S2_QUIP_02:E1S2AUD]
~z~Here comes the school bus.
[E1S2_QUIP_03:E1S2AUD]
~z~Fucking politicians.
[E1S2_QUIP_04:E1S2AUD]
~z~I ain't never going to understand politics.
[E1S2_QUIP_05:E1S2AUD]
~z~Get out the fucking way.
[E1S2_QUIP_06:E1S2AUD]
~z~Do me a favor and don't fucking eat me, back there.
[E1S2_QUIP_07:E1S2AUD]
~z~Let's get the fuck away from these pigs.

~z~This is a time sensitive situation. 

[E1S3p5_LOS_01:E1S3p5A]
~z~First goal achieved.
[E1S3p5_LOS_02:E1S3p5A]
~z~This seems promising.
[E1S3p5_LOS_03:E1S3p5A]
~z~Well done. Well done.

[E1S3p5_2V1_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~So, how do you sleep at night? 
[E1S3p5_2V1_3:E1S3p5A]
~z~Prescription meds, vodka tonics,
[E1S3p5_2V1_5:E1S3p5A]
~z~cuddling junior analysts who think they can fuck their way to a partnership. You?
[E1S3p5_2V1_7:E1S3p5A]
~z~Too much information, sister. Mine was a moral question, not a practical one. 
[E1S3p5_2V1_9:E1S3p5A]
~z~When the patron saint of killing cops and smoking meth tells you to atone, you know you've been a bad girl.

[E1S3p5_2V2_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~Home stretch. 
[E1S3p5_2V2_3:E1S3p5A]
~z~For you, maybe. Best case scenario,
[E1S3p5_2V2_5:E1S3p5A]
~z~I've got ten hours before Juan Pedro is crushing limes for my mojito on his rippled abs.
[E1S3p5_2V2_7:E1S3p5A]
~z~I don't even wanna guess what that means, but I'm thinking Juan ain't one of the schmucks who invested in your company.
[E1S3p5_2V2_9:E1S3p5A]
~z~That's right,
[E1S3p5_2V2_11:E1S3p5A]
~z~all Juan's assets are God given. And they're worth a lot more than those stocks right now.

[E1S3p5_OUT_01:E1S3p5A]
~z~Where do you think you're going?
[E1S3p5_OUT_02:E1S3p5A]
~z~Finish the job. Get back here.
[E1S3p5_OUT_03:E1S3p5A]
~z~You think you can walk away from me? Get back here!
[E1S3p5_OUT_04:E1S3p5A]
~z~Hey, hey, does this look like our destination?
[E1S3p5_OUT_05:E1S3p5A]
~z~You were paid to do a job, so fucking do it!

[E1S3p5_BYE_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~I can't say I've enjoyed your listening to your socialist hypocritical nonsense, but thanks for the ride.

[E1S3p5_CHP_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~Pass me my Bittersweet and get me to the yacht. Pronto! Come on! 

[E1S3p5_JMP_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~Juan! Juan! Up anchor, my boy. We're heading South. Vamos!

[E1S3p5_OFF_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~Get me a vodka tonic and some sedatives, okay. This hasn't been easy. 
[E1S3p5_OFF_3:E1S3p5A]
~z~Scratch that, make me a mojito, will you?

[E1S3p5_SL_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~So long, corporate America. You'll not be missed. 

[E1S3p5_DIE_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~Johnny, how's it going?
[E1S3p5_DIE_3:E1S3p5A]
~z~For me, okay. For your friend, not so well. She bought the big one. 
[E1S3p5_DIE_5:E1S3p5A]
~z~Took her last bonus. Her shares have hit the bottom. You dig?
[E1S3p5_DIE_7:E1S3p5A]
~z~I, ummm, dig, Johnny. Good to see you can't be rattled by something like this. Call me, okay?

[E1S3p5_PAS_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~Klebitz, how are you, old boy?
[E1S3p5_PAS_3:E1S3p5A]
~z~Apart from watching a woman sail into the sunset with millions of dollars that belong to mom and pop investors,
[E1S3p5_PAS_5:E1S3p5A]
~z~I'm okay.
[E1S3p5_PAS_7:E1S3p5A]
~z~Oh, well done, well done. Conscience aside, I'll send her your best on my next holiday to the Caribbean. Thanks.

[E1S3p5_KPIL_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~Mr. Congressman. I'm afraid your CEO friend is gonna have to stay and face the music.
[E1S3p5_KPIL_3:E1S3p5A]
~z~Her chopper lost it's pilot.
[E1S3p5_KPIL_5:E1S3p5A]
~z~Now that is awkward. Thanks for the heads up, sport.

[E1S3p5_DAM_1:E1S3p5A]
~z~Mr. Stubbs. Your friend's chopper experienced mechanical failure. 
[E1S3p5_DAM_3:E1S3p5A]
~z~She's not making it to that tax haven.
[E1S3p5_DAM_5:E1S3p5A]
~z~Now that is awkward. Thanks for the heads up, sport.


{Get Lost}

[E1S4_CALLP_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Right, okay, so you're there. Use your imagination.
[E1S4_CALLP_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~Maybe there's a disguise somewhere, or maybe you can get him from your side of the fence, 
[E1S4_CALLP_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~hell, maybe you can jump the wall on that bike of yours. Good luck, sport.

[E1S4_CALL2_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Klebitz?
[E1S4_CALL2_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~So, ummm, Stubbs. Billy's in a maximum security institution, how am I meant to do this? 
[E1S4_CALL2_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~You know, I would have thought your problem would be getting out, not getting into Alderney State. 
[E1S4_CALL2_7:E1S4AUD]
~z~Is there a ramp you can use? Can you get hold of a guard's uniform? 
[E1S4_CALL2_9:E1S4AUD]
~z~Jesus, come on. This is meant to be your field of expertise. Best of luck, sport.

[E1S4_CALL3_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Johnny? What is it?
[E1S4_CALL3_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~I couldn't get at Billy. He's locked down too tight.
[E1S4_CALL3_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~You know, I'm really lost as to what that's got to do with me, sport. I did all I could for you. 
[E1S4_CALL3_7:E1S4AUD]
~z~If you've learned anything at all from me, I hope it's how to cope with a crisis.
[E1S4_CALL3_9:E1S4AUD]
~z~Killing everyone around me isn't an option, Mr. Congressman. Goodbye and thank you.

[E1S4_CALL4_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Johnny?
[E1S4_CALL4_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~Angus, Billy's gone, man. Our chapter's dead. We got to give it a funeral.
[E1S4_CALL4_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~Okay, brother, let's go to church one last time then.

[E1S4_CALL5_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Johnny.
[E1S4_CALL5_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~Clay, dude, we got some hard work to do. We got to pay Billy a visit in the pen. 
[E1S4_CALL5_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~I thought it might come to this. Wait for us, brother.

[E1S4_TBKUP_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Brother. 
[E1S4_TBKUP_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~Terry, man, I've had some bad news. Billy's been singing from his cellblock.
[E1S4_TBKUP_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~Oh, man. I'm thinking you're thinking we don't have a choice. We'll come meet you. 

[E1S4_APP_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~I ain't been smugglin' nothin' into Alderney State, officer. It's all for personal consumption, man.
[E1S4_APP_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Yo, officer, we're on the same team. I can, like, beat you off or something, but no tickets, man.
[E1S4_APP_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Shit, I can't get another ticket, dude. Can I, like, suck you off or something? Come on.

[E1S4_SPOOK_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Hey, dude, you're not even a cop!
[E1S4_SPOOK_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Dude, what the fuck, man? You're not even a cop. 
[E1S4_SPOOK_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Funny joke, dude. You're no cop.

[E1S4_JACKS_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Out you come, hippie.
[E1S4_JACKS_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~You're a waste of space, dude. Get out of there.
[E1S4_JACKS_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~You've got the right to get the fuck out of here, man.

[E1S4_LOOK_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Welcome to Hell, rookie. Keep your back to the wall and your finger on the trigger. 
[E1S4_LOOK_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~This is a zoo, newbie. Don't feed the animals, don't rattle the cage. You should be fine.
[E1S4_LOOK_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~You got a ticket to the freak show, freshman. Freakiest freaks on earth in this pit. Good luck to you.

[E1S4_REPLY_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Thanks for the advice. I'm gonna go check it out.
[E1S4_REPLY_02:E1S4AUD]

~z~Johnny the jew. Come on, man.
[E1S4_BEGS_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~I'm not gonna ask how you got in here, brother.
[E1S4_BEGS_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~Jonathan Klebitz, my brother.
[E1S4_BEGS_05:E1S4AUD]
~z~Hey Johnny, what are you in for?
[E1S4_BEGS_06:E1S4AUD]
~z~You here to kick a brother while he's down?

[E1S4_RUNS_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Brotherhood don't mean nothing to you, Johnny.
[E1S4_RUNS_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~You never got it, did you? You never understood.
[E1S4_RUNS_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~You've thrown it all away, Johnny. Everything I built.
[E1S4_RUNS_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~You could have just come in visiting hours like all my other friends, Jonathan. 

[E1S4_LOOK2_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~We're in the safest place in the city. Providin' there ain't a riot, that is. 
[E1S4_LOOK2_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~I'm amazed there are still sickos loose in this town when I look at all these freaks. 
[E1S4_LOOK2_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Society's forgotten about these guys. We can do what we like to 'em. 

[E1S4_LOOK3_01:E1S4AUD]

[BG07_AA_4:E1S4AUD]
~z~What the fuck do you want?
[BG07_AA_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~Now, is that any way to treat a friend?
[BG07_AA_6:E1S4AUD]
~z~Are we friends?
[BG07_AA_7:E1S4AUD]
~z~I think so. You've certainly seen me naked. 
[BG07_AA_8:E1S4AUD]
~z~You want a cigar?
[BG07_AA_9:E1S4AUD]
~z~Do you wanna go fuck yourself?

[BG07_AA_12:E1S4AUD]
~z~Don't worry about him. 
[BG07_AA_13:E1S4AUD]
~z~Why not?
[BG07_AA_14:E1S4AUD]
~z~Apparently he and a lot of his associates are under some serious observation. 
[BG07_AA_15:E1S4AUD]
~z~And in the process of imploding. 
[BG07_AA_16:E1S4AUD]

[BG07_AA_20:E1S4AUD]
~z~He's been talking inside.

[BG07_AA_22:E1S4AUD]
~z~and your buddy in the chair. 
[BG07_AA_23:E1S4AUD]
~z~Thinks he's going into the Witness Protection Program, 
[BG07_AA_24:E1S4AUD]
~z~and if he collars you, you'll do fifteen years 
[BG07_AA_25:E1S4AUD]
~z~and he'll live in a condo in Arizona.
[BG07_AA_26:E1S4AUD]
~z~Well I don't doubt that, Mr. Stubbs. 
[BG07_AA_27:E1S4AUD]
~z~But he's on the inside.
[BG07_AA_28:E1S4AUD]
~z~I know.
[BG07_AA_29:E1S4AUD]
~z~And there's currently very large walls and armed guards between me and him. 
[BG07_AA_30:E1S4AUD]
~z~Yeah, well. You're a smart guy, you'll figure something out. 
[BG07_AA_31:E1S4AUD]
~z~If you get into trouble, you call me when you get there, 
[BG07_AA_32:E1S4AUD]
~z~I might have something to help you with it. 
[BG07_AA_33:E1S4AUD]
~z~Good, I'll need it. 
[BG07_AA_34:E1S4AUD]
~z~Hey one more thing Stubbs...

[BG07_ZA_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~Yeah, we did. But it's over. 
[BG07_ZA_6:E1S4AUD]
~z~Yeah it is. How the fuck did that happen?
[BG07_ZA_7:E1S4AUD]
~z~You know how it happens, 
[BG07_ZA_8:E1S4AUD]
~z~it's that fucked up part of people 
[BG07_ZA_9:E1S4AUD]
~z~which means good is never good enough. 
[BG07_ZA_10:E1S4AUD]
~z~I mean it wasn't enough we had to be drug dealers, 
[BG07_ZA_11:E1S4AUD]
~z~we also had to be outlaws, to be maniacs, 
[BG07_ZA_12:E1S4AUD]
~z~to be psychos and to be greedy. You know...
[BG07_ZA_13:E1S4AUD]
~z~That combination of greed and fucked up stupidity
[BG07_ZA_14:E1S4AUD]
~z~that works well in the government, 
[BG07_ZA_15:E1S4AUD]
~z~not so good if you're a fucking crook.

[E1S4_G1GET_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~We got to clear these screws outta here or they'll take us from behind.

[E1S4_G1ATK_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Billy's got us in the shit yet again.
[E1S4_G1ATK_02:E1S4AUD]

~z~You check the visitors list?
[E1S4_G1ATK_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~I always hated this shithole. 
[E1S4_G1ATK_05:E1S4AUD]
~z~You guys know William Grey?
[E1S4_G1ATK_06:E1S4AUD]
~z~Sorry, we forgot to knock.

[E1S4_G1MOV_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Come on, let's head in.

[E1S4_G2ATK_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~This ain't a prison break.
[E1S4_G2ATK_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Get the fuck out of here, you sadistic pricks.
[E1S4_G2ATK_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~How many of you assholes are on the take, huh?
[E1S4_G2ATK_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~You screws are gonna die in this shithole.
[E1S4_G2ATK_05:E1S4AUD]
~z~Bad luck. You guards are standing between me and a sonofabitch I wanna kill.
[E1S4_G2ATK_06:E1S4AUD]
~z~Tell the Warden this prison's gonna burn. 

[E1S4_SNIPE_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Heads down! There's a sniper on the roof.
[E1S4_SNIPE_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~We got a sniper up by that water tower. Watch out!
[E1S4_SNIPE_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Sniper on the roof, boys. Be careful.

[E1S4_KSINP_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Sniper's down.
[E1S4_KSINP_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~You don't need to worry about that sniper no more.
[E1S4_KSINP_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~The guy on the roof is down. We're cool.

[E1S4_G2MOV_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Let's move in deeper. Come on.
[E1S4_G2MOV_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Let's go. We gotta find Billy.
[E1S4_G2MOV_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Come on. Time to move.

[E1S4_HEAL_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Terry, man. I need some help here. Gimme first aid.
[E1S4_HEAL_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Terry, dude. You got some first aid or something? Bring it here.
[E1S4_HEAL_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Shit, Terry. Bring my a first aid kit or something.

[E1S4_G3ATK_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~We need to get through to the yard.
[E1S4_G3ATK_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~We're here for a prisoner. Not you, guards.
[E1S4_G3ATK_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~We're just here for William Grey. Save your fucking selves.
[E1S4_G3ATK_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~It ain't worth dying for the prisoners of Alderney State.
[E1S4_G3ATK_05:E1S4AUD]
~z~Get out the fucking way.
[E1S4_G3ATK_06:E1S4AUD]
~z~Sorry screws, you ain't stopping us now. 

[E1S4_RUSH1_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Terry, Clay. Push in.

[E1S4_RUSH2_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Terry. Clay. Go. Go. Go.
[E1S4_RUSH2_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Brothers. Move in. Come on.
[E1S4_RUSH2_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Rush them, you fearless motherfuckes. Come on.

[E1S4_G3MOV_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~We gotta find Billy. Come on.
[E1S4_G3MOV_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Let's find this asshole and get outta here.

[E1S4_G4ATK_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Fuck off.
[E1S4_G4ATK_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~We're just here to perform some capital punishment, people.
[E1S4_G4ATK_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Give up William Grey and we'll clear off!
[E1S4_G4ATK_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~You're about to have a riot on your hands.
[E1S4_G4ATK_05:E1S4AUD]
~z~This place is about to descend into anarchy.
[E1S4_G4ATK_06:E1S4AUD]
~z~We're the bosses here now. Get out.

[E1G4_TANDC_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Terry. Clay. Stay cool.
[E1G4_TANDC_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Keep your heads, boys. We might just survive this.
[E1G4_TANDC_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~There's a chance we might make it outta here boys. Let's fuckin' do it.
[E1G4_TANDC_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~I don't care what happens to me as long as we get Billy. Come on.
[E1G4_TANDC_05:E1S4AUD]
~z~If these assholes kill me, promise you'll get Billy, okay?
[E1G4_TANDC_06:E1S4AUD]
~z~Billy Grey sure does have a way of making mayhem.
[E1G4_TANDC_07:E1S4AUD]
~z~Clay, man. You're a good brother.
[E1G4_TANDC_08:E1S4AUD]
~z~Lost MC, yeah. I'm glad I got you two with me.
[E1G4_TANDC_09:E1S4AUD]
~z~Shit, if only Jim was with us now.
[E1G4_TANDC_10:E1S4AUD]
~z~Jim would tear through these bitches in a second.

[E1S4_YARD_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Billy! We're coming for you.
[E1S4_YARD_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~You're a dead man, Billy Grey.
[E1S4_YARD_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~You gonna roll on your brothers, Billy?
[E1S4_YARD_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~We're here to stop you talking William.
[E1S4_YARD_05:E1S4AUD]
~z~Where the fuck is Billy Grey?
[E1S4_YARD_06:E1S4AUD]
~z~You ain't talking your way outta this, Billy.
[E1S4_YARD_07:E1S4AUD]
~z~Stay the fuck away. I just wanna kill Billy Grey.
[E1S4_YARD_08:E1S4AUD]
~z~Your brothers are here, William. Come and say 'hi'.

[E1S4_JOHNY_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~I'll go find Billy, boys. You get the bikes.
[E1S4_JOHNY_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~I'm gonna take out Billy. Bring the bikes around so we can get outta here.
[E1S4_JOHNY_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Hey, you two get the bikes. I'll finish things with Billy.

[E1S4_CORNR_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~You won't find salvation here, my friend. It's too late for that.
[E1S4_CORNR_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~There's no sanctuary here William. The rules don't apply to your kind.
[E1S4_CORNR_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Well here you are, you fork-tongued bastard. I've been looking for you.

[E1S4_BIKES_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Thanks for bringing the bikes.
[E1S4_BIKES_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Good to see you. Thanks for bringing these through.
[E1S4_BIKES_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Man, am I happy to see you boys and these bikes.

[E1S4_BILLD_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~He's dead, brothers. Now all we need to worry about is getting out of here alive.
[E1S4_BILLD_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Well, Billy isn't going to be talking to anyone about us. We can clear on outta here.
[E1S4_BILLD_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~Let's get outta here, boys. Billy stopped talking bullshit for good.

[E1S4_SBIKE_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~We just wanna get the fuck outta here.
[E1S4_SBIKE_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Ain't you got rioting prisoners to worry about?
[E1S4_SBIKE_03:E1S4AUD]
~z~We got what we came for, thank you.
[E1S4_SBIKE_04:E1S4AUD]
~z~There's one prisoner you don't gotta worry about now.
[E1S4_SBIKE_05:E1S4AUD]
~z~You can lock this place down now.
[E1S4_SBIKE_06:E1S4AUD]
~z~Get out of our fucking way!
[E1S4_SBIKE_07:E1S4AUD]
~z~Coming through!
[E1S4_SBIKE_08:E1S4AUD]
~z~There still guards left in this joint?
[E1S4_SBIKE_09:E1S4AUD]
~z~We're breaking outta here. Fuck off.

[E1S4_JOUT_01:E1S4AUD]
~z~Let's go back to the house. There's one more thing we gotta do.
[E1S4_JOUT_02:E1S4AUD]
~z~Let's meet Angus at the house, guys. This thing is nearly finished.

[E1S4_CHAT1_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Billy may have helped to build our club, but he sure as shit ripped it apart.
[E1S4_CHAT1_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~I'll forgive him the insults and injuries, but I can't forgive him that.
[E1S4_CHAT1_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~Treacherous fucking bastard. He went insane.

[E1S4_CHAT2_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Terry, Clay. Thanks for rolling with me.
[E1S4_CHAT2_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~This gang is fucked all to hell right now, but I'll love you brothers until I die.
[E1S4_CHAT2_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~Man, I miss Jim. He was one princely son of a bitch. The best thing this gang ever had.

[E1S4_CHAT3_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~That shit needed to be done. Billy needed to be shut up. 
[E1S4_CHAT3_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~Funny thing is, five years ago he woulda lead the charge into Alderney State himself.
[E1S4_CHAT3_5:E1S4AUD]
~z~Drugs sent that fuck insane.

[E1S4_CHAT4_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~What the fuck is left of our chapter, boys? 
[E1S4_CHAT4_2:E1S4AUD]
~z~Dead bodies, burnt out brothers, and a clubhouse like a mausoleum. 
[E1S4_CHAT4_4:E1S4AUD]
~z~Fuck if I want it standing. It stands for bullshit, nothing more.

[E1S4_CLUBH_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~And here it fucking is.

[E1S4_TDIE_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Well, we lost Terry. Another fucking casualty to Billy Grey's junkie ego bullshit.
[E1S4_TDIE_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~I'll see you around, Brother.

[E1S4_CDIE_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Clay wouldn't be dead if Billy had just taken his time like a man. 
[E1S4_CDIE_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~I hate that bastard more and more every day. So long.

[E1S4_BIKEB_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Shit. What happened to those fucking bikes, man. 
[E1S4_BIKEB_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~We need to get more organised. Later on. 

[E1S4_VANB_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~The club's whole arsenal is an upsetting casualty. 
[E1S4_VANB_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~Fuck, but that van was bound to be volatile, wasn't it? Later, man.

[E1S4_MESSY_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Dude, I'm sorry for spoiling the party.
[E1S4_MESSY_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~I guess I just got too amped up before getting on in there. I'll see you soon.

[E1S4_ABNDN_1:E1S4AUD]
~z~Terry, man, I'm sorry. Things got too much for me in there - I fuckin' bailed.
[E1S4_ABNDN_3:E1S4AUD]
~z~We should regroup and hit that shit again. Sorry man, later on.

[E1A1_CALL2_1:E1A1AUD]
~z~You here, Johnny?
[E1A1_CALL2_3:E1A1AUD]

[E1A1_CALL2_5:E1A1AUD]

[E1A1_SHOOT_07:E1A1AUD]
~z~These guys can't hurt you no more, baby.
[E1A1_SHOOT_08:E1A1AUD]
~z~Baby, baby I'm here.

[E1A1_SHOOT2_01:E1A1AUD]
~z~Johnny, boy. I knew you'd come for me.
[E1A1_SHOOT2_02:E1A1AUD]
~z~My baby's here.
[E1A1_SHOOT2_03:E1A1AUD]
~z~Baby, baby. You came.
[E1A1_SHOOT2_04:E1A1AUD]
~z~Get me out of here, baby.
[E1A1_SHOOT2_05:E1A1AUD]
~z~I'm scared, Johnny.
[E1A1_SHOOT2_06:E1A1AUD]
~z~There you are.

[E1A1_SHOOT3_01:E1A1AUD]
~z~M - m - motherfucker.
[E1A1_SHOOT3_02:E1A1AUD]
~z~You set us up, bitch. 
[E1A1_SHOOT3_03:E1A1AUD]
~z~Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.
[E1A1_SHOOT3_04:E1A1AUD]
~z~Filthy, filthy, fucking whore.
[E1A1_SHOOT3_05:E1A1AUD]
~z~Oh man, oh man, oh man.
[E1A1_SHOOT3_06:E1A1AUD]
~z~Click, tick, tock, click. Ahhh.

[E1A1_B1V1_1:E1A1AUD]
~z~You alright?
[E1A1_B1V1_3:E1A1AUD]
~z~I'm with you now, Johnny boy. How could I not be?
[E1A1_B1V1_5:E1A1AUD]
~z~How long you been up? Two days? Three?
[E1A1_B1V1_7:E1A1AUD]
~z~Who's counting? 
[E1A1_B1V1_9:E1A1AUD]
~z~It ain't good for you, you know that.
[E1A1_B1V1_11:E1A1AUD]
~z~Sure, sure. Do you expect me to stay clean when you're not there to look after me?
[E1A1_B1V1_13:E1A1AUD]
~z~Maybe if you answered your calls... fuck. Whatever.
[E1A1_B1V1_15:E1A1AUD]
~z~Okay, I'm bad, baby. I'm bad. I know it. You should teach me a lesson. 
[E1A1_B1V1_17:E1A1AUD]
~z~Hit me or something. Teach me I'm wrong.
[E1A1_B1V1_19:E1A1AUD]
~z~Enough of that.
[E1A1_B1V1_21:E1A1AUD]
~z~Teach me, baby. It's the only way I'll learn. Make me hurt. 
[E1A1_B1V1_23:E1A1AUD]
~z~You're making yourself hurt already, you fucking idiot. 
[E1A1_B1V1_25:E1A1AUD]
~z~Hit me.
[E1A1_B1V1_27:E1A1AUD]
~z~Give me a break, sweetheart. I used to fucking love you.
[E1A1_B1V1_29:E1A1AUD]
~z~You're too sweet for words, Johnny boy. You think I'm sweet, too?
[E1A1_B1V1_31:E1A1AUD]
~z~You ain't good for me, sugar. That's all I know.

[E1A1_ARRV_1:E1A1AUD]
~z~Home, sweet home.

[E1A1_TWEEK_01:E1A1AUD]
~z~Hold on baby, let me handle this.
[E1A1_TWEEK_02:E1A1AUD]
~z~Stay cool, Ash. Let Daddy take care of this.
[E1A1_TWEEK_03:E1A1AUD]
~z~You sure have got a lot of friends, Ash. Wait while I take care of 'em.

[E1A1_MORE_01:E1A1AUD]
~z~Johnny, Johnny, there's more of them!
[E1A1_MORE_02:E1A1AUD]
~z~Either I'm trippin' or we're fucked. Look out, baby.
[E1A1_MORE_03:E1A1AUD]
~z~Fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck! More of 'em, Johnny K!

[E1A1_SCREAM_01:E1A1AUD]
~z~My boyfriends gonna splatter your brains across this place!
[E1A1_SCREAM_02:E1A1AUD]
~z~I'm not paying you a fucking cent.
[E1A1_SCREAM_03:E1A1AUD]
~z~Help me! Help me!
[E1A1_SCREAM_04:E1A1AUD]
~z~Fuck! Will somebody fucking help me!
[E1A1_SCREAM_05:E1A1AUD]
~z~This is so not fucking cool.
[E1A1_SCREAM_06:E1A1AUD]
~z~Ahhhhhhh!

[E1A1_HIT_01:E1A1AUD]
~z~That's enough now, sugar.
[E1A1_HIT_02:E1A1AUD]
~z~That hurts real good, Johnny.
[E1A1_HIT_03:E1A1AUD]
~z~Gentle, baby. I'm only little.

[E1A1_B1V2_1:E1A1AUD]
~z~God, Ashley. Sometimes I wish I didn't care about you.
[E1A1_B1V2_3:E1A1AUD]
~z~Oh, baby. You don't mean that, do you? You're all I've got.
[E1A1_B1V2_5:E1A1AUD]
~z~Me and the crystal, of course.
[E1A1_B1V2_7:E1A1AUD]
~z~I told you. I'm not friends with Tina no more. I ain't gonna lose me to meth..
[E1A1_B1V2_9:E1A1AUD]
~z~Well, you lost me to it.
[E1A1_B1V2_11:E1A1AUD]
~z~So, Billy's back. How's things?
[E1A1_B1V2_13:E1A1AUD]
~z~Don't you know? Haven't you two been seeing anything of each other?
[E1A1_B1V2_15:E1A1AUD]
~z~No... yeah. He's around, isn't he?
[E1A1_B1V2_17:E1A1AUD]
~z~Something's around. Not the Billy I knew. 
[E1A1_B1V2_19:E1A1AUD]
~z~Not the Billy that made me want to lead this life in the first place.
[E1A1_B1V2_21:E1A1AUD]
~z~Oh, man, Johnny. You keep talking about how people have changed. 
[E1A1_B1V2_23:E1A1AUD]
~z~Don't you think maybe you're the one who's different?
[E1A1_B1V2_25:E1A1AUD]
~z~Fuck you, Ashley. I ain't changed. I stuck to the code I set myself. 
[E1A1_B1V2_27:E1A1AUD]
~z~You try and live by what makes sense, take your own path and it burns you out. 
[E1A1_B1V2_29:E1A1AUD]
~z~You're funny, Johnny. You care about everyone else when they're fine. And you end up tying yourself in a knot.
[E1A1_B1V2_31:E1A1AUD]
~z~Yeah, everything in my life's fucking fantastic.

[E1A1_ONWAY_1:E1A1AUD]
~z~Johnny, what's happening?
[E1A1_ONWAY_3:E1A1AUD]
~z~I'm on my way, baby. You still in this fix?
[E1A1_ONWAY_5:E1A1AUD]
~z~He's crazy, Johnny. The ice has really screwed up his shit. 
[E1A1_ONWAY_7:E1A1AUD]
~z~I thought you and Tina weren't friends no more.
[E1A1_ONWAY_9:E1A1AUD]
~z~I can't talk about this now. Lecture me all you like later on, but right now, I need help. Please, sugar.
[E1A1_ONWAY_11:E1A1AUD]
~z~Hold tight.

[E1A1_AA_1:E1A1AUD]
~z~Nice place you got here, sugar. 
[E1A1_AA_2:E1A1AUD]
~z~Not now, honey. I ain't feelin' so good.
[E1A1_AA_3:E1A1AUD]
~z~I thought you'd said you stopped smoking that stuff?
[E1A1_AA_4:E1A1AUD]
~z~I did, Johnny boy. I did. 
[E1A1_AA_5:E1A1AUD]
~z~I promise. 
[E1A1_AA_6:E1A1AUD]
~z~I never lied to you. 
[E1A1_AA_7:E1A1AUD]
~z~Come on, baby. That's crap and you know it.
[E1A1_AA_8:E1A1AUD]
~z~I never lied to you when I was sober. 
[E1A1_AA_9:E1A1AUD]
~z~Well, my whole life's falling to shit, sweetheart. 
[E1A1_AA_10:E1A1AUD]
~z~I guess it was dumb of me to think this would be any different.
[E1A1_AA_11:E1A1AUD]
~z~I'm sorry. I know I ain't much, 
[E1A1_AA_12:E1A1AUD]
~z~but I'm all yours. You do know that, baby, don't you?

[E1A1_AA_22:E1A1AUD]
~z~You, me and that little habit of yours.
[E1A1_AA_23:E1A1AUD]
~z~You're my habit, Johnny. 
[E1A1_AA_24:E1A1AUD]
~z~And you are ridiculous.

[E1A1_BA_2:E1A1AUD]
~z~And you sure know how to get me out, Johnny.

[E1A1_BA_6:E1A1AUD]
~z~Can we go? 
[E1A1_BA_7:E1A1AUD]
~z~I don't wanna hang here neither.
[E1A1_BA_8:E1A1AUD]
~z~Then again, I'm not the one messing up my head on a week long ice binge.
[E1A1_BA_9:E1A1AUD]
~z~I remember when you used to mess around at my place, 
[E1A1_BA_10:E1A1AUD]
~z~that don't happen any more either. 
[E1A1_BA_11:E1A1AUD]

{Roman's Holiday}

[E1A2_CALL1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Dude, you busy? I got something and I don't need it getting round the clubhouse. I'll owe you, brother.
[E1A2_CALL1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~What you need Johnny?
[E1A2_CALL1_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~I need to snatch some guy name of uhh, Roman Bellic. Runs a cab firm,
[E1A2_CALL1_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~in debt to some Russians. You down? I'll pay.
[E1A2_CALL1_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~Uhh, aight. I'm up on Y in Northwood. See you in a minute.

[E1A2_B1AV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~So, we got a plan, Johnny boy?
[E1A2_B1AV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Of course we've got a plan.
[E1A2_B1AV1_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~We snatch this guy, deliver him to some other guys, then we pat ourselves on the back for doing a great job.
[E1A2_B1AV1_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Sounds simple as shit.
[E1A2_B1AV1_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~If you want Wingit Presentation before every job you do, you're running with the wrong crowd.

[E1A2_B1BV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Who is this guy? Why you want him snatched?
[E1A2_B1BV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~I dunno. I'm doin' this as a favor for a friend.
[E1A2_B1BV1_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Huh, huh. Must be a good friend.
[E1A2_B1BV1_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~It's complicated.
[E1A2_B1BV1_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh, it's like that, is it, now? She like your girlfriend or something? Nah, nah, that's cool. I'm feeling that.
[E1A2_B1BV1_11:E1A2AUD]
~z~Things is coming together, starting to make sense now.

[E1A2_B1CV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~She ain't my old lady, alright?
[E1A2_B1CV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Sure, sure she ain't. Thats why you running all over town trying to snatch a fool up, huh? Please.
[E1A2_B1CV1_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~She's a friend and she's in trouble. I believe in looking out for people you've been close to.
[E1A2_B1CV1_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~You and your boys might ride, but you don't know nothing about brotherhood.
[E1A2_B1CV1_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~Shit. I know about brothers, but I know about bitches as well. 
[E1A2_B1CV1_11:E1A2AUD]
~z~And this here job - smells like a bitch to me. It got bitch-stink all over it, son.
[E1A2_B1CV1_13:E1A2AUD]
~z~Thank God I'm hanging out with another two-bit street philosopher.

[E1A2_B1DV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~She playing you? She in trouble?
[E1A2_B1DV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~I don't know. Both maybe. Fuck it. Shut up for a second. 
[E1A2_B1DV1_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~You know, Malc, I think you've got unresolved women issues. 
[E1A2_B1DV1_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Were you close to your mother growing up? Did she let you down?
[E1A2_B1DV1_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~We ain't kidnapping nobody because of my mamma, Johnny. It's your lady friend getting us to do this. Think on that, son.

[E1A2_B1AV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Roman Bellic. What the fuck kind of name is that?
[E1A2_B1AV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~I don't know, Greek?
[E1A2_B1AV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Sounds like it's Eastern European or some shit.
[E1A2_B1AV2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Greek's in the East of Europe.
[E1A2_B1AV2_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yeah, that's what I said. Maybe Italian or Rome or some shit.

[E1A2_B1BV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~All the immigrants you meet seem to be from Russia.
[E1A2_B1BV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~What happened to the days when it was guys coming across from Mexico?
[E1A2_B1BV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Or in your case, guys coming from a 1950s time warp.
[E1A2_B1BV2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~That's good, Malc. Real good.

[E1A2_B1CV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Why are all you bikers racist, just like the Angels of Death?
[E1A2_B1CV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~The Lost aren't like those Deadbeats. Take a look at my brothers, man. 
[E1A2_B1CV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~We're more like equal opportunity haters - we hate assholes and fools, wherever they're from. 
[E1A2_B1CV2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh, wait. You hate me because where I'm from? Man, that's cold.
[E1A2_B1CV2_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~I knew you were a fucking racist. I fucking knew it. Stop the car. 
[E1A2_B1CV2_11:E1A2AUD]
~z~Malc, man, come on. 
[E1A2_B1CV2_13:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yo, lighten up, Johnny boy. I'm just fucking with you son.

[E1A2_B1DV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~So, yeah this guy we're snatching isn't the only European-type dude I've come across recently. 
[E1A2_B1DV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Is that a fact?
[E1A2_B1DV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Worked with this other guy, he could handle himself. Maybe this guy will be the same.
[E1A2_B1DV2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Most Europeans are gay, man. That's why they wear them tight-ass jeans.
[E1A2_B1DV2_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~Is that a fact? I'll bare that in mind, Malc.

[E1A2_CALL2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Hello, this is Bellic and Bellic Enterprises. What can I assist you with? 
[E1A2_CALL2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Is Roman Bellic there?
[E1A2_CALL2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Ummm.... ahhhh... I... Mr. Bellic is very busy man. An important and busy man.
[E1A2_CALL2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~I think he's on a hot date or something. What is it you need from him?
[E1A2_CALL2_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~We got two college coeds over here and,
[E1A2_CALL2_11:E1A2AUD]
~z~they're in need of a Limo'. And I'm told this Bellic guy's the man for that kind of work.
[E1A2_CALL2_13:E1A2AUD]
~z~Well, in that case I'll... I mean, ah...
[E1A2_CALL2_14:E1A2AUD]
~z~We'll try to contact Mr. Bellic and have him come as soon as possible.

[E1A2_LIMO_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Ladies, ladies, ladies.
[E1A2_LIMO_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~You have got yourselves the best Limo driver in the whole of Liberty City. 
[E1A2_LIMO_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~I'll take you through the bright lights of Star Junction, past the glamorous shops of Middle Park West, 
[E1A2_LIMO_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~and, if you're lucky,
[E1A2_LIMO_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~you might end the tour with a look at the finest specimen of manhood in the entire metropolitan area. 
[E1A2_LIMO_11:E1A2AUD]
~z~Wait, where are the ladies? Who are you?
[E1A2_LIMO_13:E1A2AUD]
~z~Get in the car, fat man. Your ass has just been snatched.
[E1A2_LIMO_15:E1A2AUD]
~z~Don't try nothing, chubby. It ain't like you're a difficult target to hit.
[E1A2_LIMO_17:E1A2AUD]
~z~Help me! 

[E1A2_GOING_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~We gotta take the fat man to a warehouse in Bohan. 
[E1A2_GOING_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~You're wanted in Bohan, fatty.
[E1A2_GOING_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~How do you like Bohan, Mr. Bellic? Some pals are waiting for you there.

[E1A2_B2AV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Ahhhh. Help me. Someone. I'm too young to die. Please. 
[E1A2_B2AV1_3:E1A2AUD]

[E1A2_B2AV1_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yeah, shut the fuck up. Ya heard?

[E1A2_B2BV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Jesus, help me! Somebody help me!
[E1A2_B2BV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Shit, Jay. Can you pop this motherfucker and shut him up?
[E1A2_B2BV1_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh no, please. 
[E1A2_B2BV1_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~Can't you see I'm trying to drive here? You fucking pop him.
[E1A2_B2BV1_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~Help! Help! Help! Help! 

[E1A2_B2CV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Man, I just got me this nine. I don't wanna go puttin' no bodies on it already. 
[E1A2_B2CV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~But shit, I like this gun.
[E1A2_B2CV1_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Why? Why?
[E1A2_B2CV1_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~I'll buy you a new one. Just shut this dude up.
[E1A2_B2CV1_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~ I'll be quiet, I promise.
[E1A2_B2CV1_10:E1A2AUD]
~z~I told you, I like this gun. I ain't getting no bodies on it. Not today. 
[E1A2_B2CV1_12:E1A2AUD]
~z~And not this Rusty Brown's munching, quadruple Bleeder Burger eating motherfucker. 
[E1A2_B2CV1_14:E1A2AUD]
~z~Help me! Help me!

[E1A2_B2DV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Just pop the fucker. And you can get the bullets outta him afterwards and no one's gonna trace that shit back to you.
[E1A2_B2DV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~No, no! Please!
[E1A2_B2DV1_4:E1A2AUD]
~z~Hell no, I don't wanna get my hands all dirty and shit. Get gravy all on my new manicured fingers.
[E1A2_B2DV1_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~~s~

[E1A2_B2EV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Man, can you smell that?
[E1A2_B2EV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~~s~
[E1A2_B2EV1_4:E1A2AUD]
~z~Dammit, dude done pissed his self. That shit ain't right. 
[E1A2_B2EV1_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~~s~

[E1A2_B2FV1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~From the smell, it ain't just piss. I'm glad I ain't sitting back there with him.
[E1A2_B2FV1_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~~s~
[E1A2_B2FV1_4:E1A2AUD]
~z~Damn you better not be right. What's wrong with you, man? We was only joshing you. Tell him, Johnny.
[E1A2_B2FV1_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~Huh?
[E1A2_B2FV1_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~We're just meant to kidnap you. 
[E1A2_B2FV1_10:E1A2AUD]
~z~If you were meant to be going in the ground, you wouldn't be conversing with us gentlemen like this. 
[E1A2_B2FV1_12:E1A2AUD]
~z~Pull yourself together man.
[E1A2_B2FV1_13:E1A2AUD]
~z~~s~
[E1A2_B2FV1_15:E1A2AUD]
~z~Shit.

[E1A2_2AV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Please. Please. I'll pay you anything. 
[E1A2_2AV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~I think he's trying to say something, Malc.
[E1A2_2AV2_4:E1A2AUD]
~z~I can get money, I promise.
[E1A2_2AV2_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~I don't know, I ain't hearing shit. 

[E1A2_B2BV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Okay. Okay. My cousin, he has money. He will pay you.
[E1A2_B2BV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh, I get it. I think the man's trying to give us some money. 
[E1A2_B2BV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~We let him go and he'll come back with a bag full of unmarked twenties, right?
[E1A2_B2BV2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yes. Yes. Exactly. Exactly.

[E1A2_B2CV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~You mean, he's like trying to bribe us?
[E1A2_B2CV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yeah.
[E1A2_B2CV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~I hope he knows that you and me are men of integrity, Malc. 
[E1A2_B2CV2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~And that we'd find something like that real insulting.
[E1A2_B2CV2_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~~s~
[E1A2_B2CV2_10:E1A2AUD]
~z~Did you mean to insult us, Mr. Roman Bellic? I sure hope not.
[E1A2_B2CV2_12:E1A2AUD]
~z~Help! Help!

[E1A2_2DV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Help me! Help me!
[E1A2_2DV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Malc, tell this gentlemen what my kind of people do to guys who try to buy their way out.
[E1A2_2DV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Just so you know who you dealing with, Mr. Bellic. This is one screwed up dumb redneck motherfucker.
[E1A2_2DV2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh lord, please help me. 
[E1A2_2DV2_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~Hey now listen, I do mean motherfucker in the most literal sense. Serious incest motherfucker.
[E1A2_2DV2_10:E1A2AUD]
~z~Fucking you up the ass with a barb wire dick would be a pleasure for this man.
[E1A2_2DV2_12:E1A2AUD]
~z~Lord, I am sorry for all the women I've chased,
[E1A2_2DV2_14:E1A2AUD]
~z~the money I have wasted, the internet porn.

[E1A2_2EV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yeah, this biker dude is twisted as all hell, man. By the way how many guys you killed, son?
[E1A2_2EV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~You mean, like, this year or in my whole career?
[E1A2_2EV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Aight just this year, man, we ain't got time for all that shit.
[E1A2_2EV2_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~It's been a good year, you know? 

[E1A2_2FV2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh Lord, I apologise for sleeping with those twins.
[E1A2_2FV2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~You should apologize for that smell. You shat yourself or something?
[E1A2_2FV2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~God damn.
[E1A2_2FV2_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~Lord, I am sorry for shitting myself. 
[E1A2_2FV2_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~and for laughing at Brucie's balls.

[E1A2_GETOUT_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Johnny, man, this job was your idea. What are you doing?
[E1A2_GETOUT_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Where you off to, Johnny boy? We kind of in the middle of something right here, man.
[E1A2_GETOUT_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~Ummm, Johnny, my dude, we're going to do this or what? What the fuck is wrong with you?

[E1A2_LOSE_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Shit dude, we got to get five-o off our ass.
[E1A2_LOSE_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Shit's hot, Johnny. Get these motherfuckers off us.
[E1A2_LOSE_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~Much as I like rolling with an escort, we really got to lose these fucking oinkers.

[E1A2_RUNS_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Run for it, Roman. Run!
[E1A2_RUNS_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Come on Roman, escape!
[E1A2_RUNS_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~You'll never take me alive! 

[E1A2_GETR_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~I ain't going after him.
[E1A2_GETR_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~You go get him, he ain't gonna be hard to catch.
[E1A2_GETR_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~We doing this for your girl, so you do the running. 

[E1A2_RUNS2_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~I shouldn't have eaten those burgers.
[E1A2_RUNS2_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~If only I was fitter.
[E1A2_RUNS2_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~Move, you fat, stupid legs, move!
[E1A2_RUNS2_04:E1A2AUD]
~z~If I close my eyes they can't see me, if I close my eyes they can't see me.
[E1A2_RUNS2_05:E1A2AUD]
~z~I think I'm having a heart attack. I feel numb. Oh God, oh God.
[E1A2_RUNS2_06:E1A2AUD]
~z~Head for the hills, Roman. Come on!

[E1A2_SUBMIT_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Alright, you win. I know when to fold my hand.
[E1A2_SUBMIT_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Okay, I couldn't run any further if I wanted to.
[E1A2_SUBMIT_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~I nearly had you, buddy. You got to admit that?

[E1A2_GETIN_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Squeeze your fat ass in there.
[E1A2_GETIN_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Come on, piggly-wiggly. We need some grease or something?
[E1A2_GETIN_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~If it was a box of donuts you'd get your fat ass in there.

[E1A2_IN_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~We're lucky that the fat man can't run. Next time, lock the damn hostage up.
[E1A2_IN_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~For future reference, Malc, it might be worth locking your hostages into a car.

[E1A2_RESP_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~He ain't gonna make a play like that again. Believe that.
[E1A2_RESP_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Alright, man. I'll make sure it don't repeat itself.
[E1A2_RESP_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~I got a leash on him now, don't worry 'bout a thing.

[E1A2_DROP_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Hit the road, fat man. I'm not in the kidnapping mood right now.
[E1A2_DROP_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Thank you, sir. Thank you.

[E1A2_DROP2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Well, uh, that kidnapping - didn't go too well, did it?
[E1A2_DROP2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Nah. A living hostage is one of the prerequisites for a successful snatching, ain't it?
[E1A2_DROP2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yeah this has got to be kind of awkward, man. I'm going to slip off. Peace.

[E1A2_TRASH_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Man, I just jacked that car?
[E1A2_TRASH_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yeah we just stole this guy, too. But I guess we gotta let him go. I'll be seeing the both of you.
[E1A2_TRASH_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

[E1A2_FAIL_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Hey babe.
[E1A2_FAIL_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Ashley, you need to tell your Russian loan shark that the guy they're after is dead. 
[E1A2_FAIL_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh shit, Johnny. Shit. What happened? I thought you were looking out for me. 
[E1A2_FAIL_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~They'll turn me out. I don't know what I'm going to do. Shit.

[E1A2_FAIL2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Hey.
[E1A2_FAIL2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Hey there, babe. Something went wrong. This job isn't happening. Stay safe.
[E1A2_FAIL2_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Damn, Johnny. I thought you cared about me. You can't leave me like this. Johnny...

[E1A2_FAIL3_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Baby?
[E1A2_FAIL3_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Those Russians have got their guy. You got lucky, but you got to control yourself, Ashley. 
[E1A2_FAIL3_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~The ice got you into this mess.
[E1A2_FAIL3_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~I know I am, Johnny. And you know what's the best thing about me? You. Call me, okay?

[E1A2_MALC_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh, shit man. Hell no.

[E1A2_DROPM_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~How the fuck we meant to snatch a man-up when we ain't got nothing to put him in?
[E1A2_DROPM_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yeah you're right man, we ain't snatching that guy today.
[E1A2_DROPM_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~If he only knew how close he came though. Thanks, Malc. 

[E1A2_TARGET_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~You want to die, fat man? 
[E1A2_TARGET_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~You ain't a difficult target to hit, Mr. Bellic. 
[E1A2_TARGET_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~Bellic, I wanted to kidnap you, now I might kill ya. 
[E1A2_TARGET_04:E1A2AUD]
~z~Get back in the car.
[E1A2_TARGET_05:E1A2AUD]
~z~Come back here! 

[E1A2_BA_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Nice rice rocket you got there. 
[E1A2_BA_2:E1A2AUD]
~z~It come with a fortune cookie?
[E1A2_BA_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~As a matter of fact it did. 
[E1A2_BA_4:E1A2AUD]
~z~Told me I was gonna meet some 1950s lookin' motherfucker 
[E1A2_BA_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~who preferred rusty oil dripping junk to hi-tech precision machinery.
[E1A2_BA_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~Rusty oil dripping American junk.
[E1A2_BA_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Bitch please... your patriotism is making you ignorant. 
[E1A2_BA_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~Anyway, we gonna go grab somebody. 
[E1A2_BA_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~We need four wheels, I got that.
[E1A2_BA_10:E1A2AUD]
~z~Alright man, but I'm driving the cage.
[E1A2_BA_11:E1A2AUD]
~z~Now you sure you know how? 
[E1A2_BA_12:E1A2AUD]
~z~Watch and learn my friend. 
[E1A2_BA_13:E1A2AUD]
~z~Watch and fuckin' learn.

[E1A2_CA_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Hello. 
[E1A2_CA_2:E1A2AUD]
~z~Aye, yo man. How you doin'?
[E1A2_CA_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Please, gentlemen. The men in there just took my money.
[E1A2_CA_4:E1A2AUD]
~z~I can't get robbed twice in one day. 
[E1A2_CA_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~What do you want the shirt off my back? Come on.
[E1A2_CA_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~We're not robbing you, we're taking you. 
[E1A2_CA_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~Your chips've been cashed, chubby.
[E1A2_CA_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~-No! Wait.~n~-Get in there and shut up!
[E1A2_CA_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~Somebody. Stop. Somebody! Help! 
[E1A2_CA_10:E1A2AUD]
~z~Shut your fat ass up.

[E1A3_AA_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~You're here. You're here. Oh man... Johnny... 
[E1A3_AA_2:E1A2AUD]
~z~What's the matter, sugar?
[E1A3_AA_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Oh, Johnny. I fucked up. I fucked up real bad.
[E1A3_AA_4:E1A2AUD]
~z~What'd you do?
[E1A3_AA_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~I messed up, baby... promise you won't be mad.
[E1A3_AA_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~Why, what'd you do?
[E1A3_AA_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~I'm an addict. I need help.
[E1A3_AA_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~What the fuck did you do?
[E1A3_AA_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~You must be Johnny.
[E1A3_AA_10:E1A2AUD]
~z~Who are you? 
[E1A3_AA_11:E1A2AUD]
~z~-My name is not important.~n~-What is this?
[E1A3_AA_12:E1A2AUD]
~z~-Your woman here owes Dimitri Rascalov a lot of money.~n~-Okay.
[E1A3_AA_13:E1A2AUD]
~z~-We need you to do us favor.~n~-What?
[E1A3_AA_14:E1A2AUD]
~z~We need you to kidnap someone for us.
[E1A3_AA_15:E1A2AUD]
~z~Well, I'm not in the kidnapping business, dude.
[E1A3_AA_16:E1A2AUD]
~z~And I'm not in the dude business, dude. 
[E1A3_AA_17:E1A2AUD]
~z~You either do it, or junky gets killed. 
[E1A3_AA_18:E1A2AUD]
~z~Not difficult decision, even for a man stuck in 1960s time warp.
[E1A3_AA_19:E1A2AUD]
~z~It's easy. You grab him and deliver him to warehouse, off Lompoc in Bohan Industrial. 
[E1A3_AA_20:E1A2AUD]
~z~And this'll pay off her debts?
[E1A3_AA_21:E1A2AUD]
~z~Well...
[E1A3_AA_22:E1A2AUD]
~z~it pays off interest.
[E1A3_AA_23:E1A2AUD]
~z~Wonderful...
[E1A3_AA_24:E1A2AUD]
~z~-The name of the man we want is Roman Bellic.~n~-Yeah.
[E1A3_AA_25:E1A2AUD]
~z~He runs a cab business, 
[E1A3_AA_26:E1A2AUD]
~z~but hangs around some backroom gambling place on Dillon Street in Schottler. 
[E1A3_AA_27:E1A2AUD]
~z~I got it.
[E1A3_AA_28:E1A2AUD]
~z~You find him, you take him... 
[E1A3_AA_29:E1A2AUD]
~z~Now, run along. 
[E1A3_AA_30:E1A2AUD]
~z~Ashley you gotta stop fucking things up...
[E1A3_AA_31:E1A2AUD]
~z~Fuck!

[E1A3_ZA_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Somebody looking for a fat Slav with a bladder problem?
[E1A3_ZA_2:E1A2AUD]
~z~So this is Roman Bellic? 
[E1A3_ZA_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~Not such a tough guy, eh?
[E1A3_ZA_4:E1A2AUD]
~z~What is all this fuss about his cousin?
[E1A3_ZA_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Listen, buddy. Ashley is square with you now.
[E1A3_ZA_6:E1A2AUD]
~z~So do me a favor, go easy on the fat man. 
[E1A3_ZA_7:E1A2AUD]
~z~I've seen some of those bodies you people dump in the Humboldt. 
[E1A3_ZA_8:E1A2AUD]
~z~Easy, Johnny... you saw the shit stains in the back seat. 
[E1A3_ZA_9:E1A2AUD]
~z~He's scared enough.
[E1A3_ZA_10:E1A2AUD]
~z~What happens to this shithead is none of your concern. 
[E1A3_ZA_11:E1A2AUD]
~z~You, come with me.
[E1A3_ZA_12:E1A2AUD]
~z~Shit, Johnny. Yo I gotta bounce. 
[E1A3_ZA_13:E1A2AUD]
~z~Be easy, man.

[E1A2_DROP3_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Well, uh, that kidnapping - didn't go too well, did it?
[E1A2_DROP3_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~How did a fat motherfucker like that get away from two young fit dudes like us? 
[E1A2_DROP3_5:E1A2AUD]
~z~Yeah this has got to be kind of awkward, man. I'm going to slip off. Peace.

[E1A2_CHUB_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Get in there, you fat fuck.
[E1A2_CHUB_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Squeeze in, fatso.
[E1A2_CHUB_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~Get in, fat man.

[E1A2_CAR_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Get back here!
[E1A2_CAR_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Get back in the fucking car.
[E1A2_CAR_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~Get your ass back here.

[E1A2_KILLY_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Do that again and you're a dead man. A fat dead man.
[E1A2_KILLY_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~You pull a stunt like that again, and it's over for you, bacon ass.
[E1A2_KILLY_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~I'll fucking kill you if you run again, fatty. 

[E1A2_NAG_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~Come on. Get back in the car.
[E1A2_NAG_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~Move them fat little legs of yours.
[E1A2_NAG_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~We ain't got all day.
[E1A2_NAG_04:E1A2AUD]
~z~A quick kidnapping's a good kidnapping. Come on.
[E1A2_NAG_05:E1A2AUD]
~z~Sooner you get over there the sooner this will all be over with. 

[E1A2_DEN_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~There he is. Let's get him.
[E1A2_DEN_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~That's got to be him. Come on.
[E1A2_DEN_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~Alright. I'm guessing that's him.

[E1A2_WAIT1_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~Okay, now all we got to do is wait for this guy to come out of there. 
[E1A2_WAIT1_2:E1A2AUD]
~z~I'm hoping he ain't too good at poker. Hell, if we're here because of his debts, he can't exactly be the Buffet Car.

[E1A2_WAIT2_1:E1A2AUD]
~z~I hope this motherfucker hurries up and loses his money so we can snatch him.
[E1A2_WAIT2_3:E1A2AUD]
~z~We're on the clock here. 

[E1A2_RECOG_01:E1A2AUD]
~z~How come all the Slavs in this city wear shitty tracksuits, man?
[E1A2_RECOG_02:E1A2AUD]
~z~You know, this ain't the first grungy European I've met recently.
[E1A2_RECOG_03:E1A2AUD]
~z~All you Europeans got the same fucking accent.


{Heavy Toll}

[E1E1_VAN_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~Aight, go ahead, go ahead. Let's go.
[E1E1_VAN_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~Keep it moving, okay?
[E1E1_VAN_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yeah, yeah, you're good to go. You're good, go, go.

[E1E1_DELAY1_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Hey, I can't be to sure but this looks like one of those fake bills I've been hearing about.
[E1E1_DELAY1_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~You know how it is can't trust nothing these days. Can't trust the price of gas,
[E1E1_DELAY1_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~can't trust this President for sure, and you know you can't even trust this money.

[E1E1_DELAY1B_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~I mean, you heard about the credit crunch? It's crunching underneath my feet. 
[E1E1_DELAY1B_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~I can't take care of my mortgage, you know I got me kids.
[E1E1_DELAY1B_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~I got kids I can't even claim. The government gone and fucked us good. You know it, you know it, I know you know it.
[E1E1_DELAY1B_7:E1E1AUD]
~z~Things can't be going too well for you if you heading to Bohan. Am I right?

[E1E1_DELAY2_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yo, wait. Don't I recognise you? Wait a minute, wait a minute...
[E1E1_DELAY2_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Shit, I could swear you was on that show - America's Next Top Hooker.
[E1E1_DELAY2_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yeah, you was like John number four or some shit. Right?

[E1E1_DELAY2B_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Man can those bitches suck on a dick!
[E1E1_DELAY2B_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Guess they wouldn't be top hookers if they couldn't. 
[E1E1_DELAY2B_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~Plenty of mediocre hookers out here I guess. You really got to be on some dick sucking skill level to be on the top.

[E1E1_DELAY3_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Sorry, sorry, it's my first day. This might take a minute.
[E1E1_DELAY3_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Seems like everybody here wants to come through this here little gate.
[E1E1_DELAY3_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~What's the big deal about Bohan anyways? Bohan ain't shit, that's for sure.

[E1E1_DELAY3B_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~I mean, what's Bohan got? Give me a good reason why you wanna go to Bohan.
[E1E1_DELAY3B_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~You want to get the clap or some shit? You want to get shot?
[E1E1_DELAY3B_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~That's all the shit that happens in Bohans. Death and a dripping dick.

[E1E1_ANNOY_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~ Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you let me through?
[E1E1_ANNOY_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~Enough of this shit, just let me through, okay?
[E1E1_ANNOY_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~Are you really wasting my time like this? Come on.

[E1E1_SHOOT_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~Don't shoot the van, Johnny.
[E1E1_SHOOT_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~That's the van we're trying to steal, John.
[E1E1_SHOOT_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~Don't fuck up our money, Johnny.
[E1E1_SHOOT_04:E1E1AUD]
~z~Come on, Johnny. Ease up on that van.

[E1E1_COMBAT_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yo, give up the van.
[E1E1_COMBAT_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~Give up that van now.
[E1E1_COMBAT_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~Oh, you in trouble now.
[E1E1_COMBAT_04:E1E1AUD]
~z~You might just get me angry, you hear.
[E1E1_COMBAT_05:E1E1AUD]
~z~You going make me lose my mind.
[E1E1_COMBAT_06:E1E1AUD]
~z~Come on, motherfuckers.

[E1E1_COVER_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~Get in cover, Johnny.
[E1E1_COVER_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~Johnny, boy, find some cover.
[E1E1_COVER_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~I don't wanna take you to hospital, man. Get in cover.
[E1E1_COVER_04:E1E1AUD]
~z~You trying to get shot, Johnny?

[E1E1_DESEAN_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~Fucking bitches.
[E1E1_DESEAN_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~Here we go.
[E1E1_DESEAN_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~You done.

~z~You robbed.
[E1E1_DESEAN_05:E1E1AUD]
~z~Come on, now
[E1E1_DESEAN_06:E1E1AUD]
~z~You really want me to shoot you?

[E1E1_CHAT1_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~You alright there, Johnny?
[E1E1_CHAT1_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yeah, man. I'm cool. Just holla if you need any help now.

[E1E1_CHAT2_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Come on, Johnny. Pull your weight, yeah?
[E1E1_CHAT2_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Pull on my Johnson, Malc.

[E1E1_CHAT3_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Having fun there, Malc?
[E1E1_CHAT3_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Oh yeah. For sure.

[E1E1_CHAT4_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~How many you got now, Malc?
[E1E1_CHAT4_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Shit, I don't know. Lost count, son.

[E1E1_2CHAT1_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Hey Johnny, you and them Lost bikers ain't that bad.
[E1E1_2CHAT1_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~We been kicking ass way longer than you young bucks, that's for sure.

[E1E1_2CHAT2_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~DeSean, stay in cover, man.
[E1E1_2CHAT2_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~I'm cool. I'm cool.

[E1E1_GETIN_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~We need to get this van out of here. Get in, man.
[E1E1_GETIN_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~We ain't hanging round man. Get up in this van, okay?

[E1E1_WHERE_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~We got a lockup on the Point, man. Come on.
[E1E1_WHERE_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~Take us to the Point, Johnny. We got a lockup there.

[E1E1_B1V1_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~So, Malcolm, I got a question for you.
[E1E1_B1V1_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Sure thing, Jonathan. Shoot. 
[E1E1_B1V1_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~Well, Malcolm, it's your crew. The Uptown Riders. 
[E1E1_B1V1_7:E1E1AUD]
~z~Are you a, a motorcycle club like us and the Angels of Death? 
[E1E1_B1V1_9:E1E1AUD]
~z~I don't know. I mean, we ride bikes and we ride them hard. But the thing is
[E1E1_B1V1_11:E1E1AUD]
~z~we don't wear fancy dresses or do pinky finger shakes or anything like that. So I ain't sure what that makes us.

[E1E1_B2V1_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~We're adults here, Malcolm. 
[E1E1_B2V1_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Allegedly, Johnny boy. Allegedly.
[E1E1_B2V1_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~So let's not let this descend into an argument 
[E1E1_B2V1_7:E1E1AUD]
~z~about the merits of good American machinery versus foreign plastic fantastic crap. 
[E1E1_B2V1_9:E1E1AUD]
~z~Or why you guys look like rejects from a bondage club.
[E1E1_B2V1_11:E1E1AUD]
~z~Or, why you guys dress like the Republican Space Rangers.
[E1E1_B2V1_13:E1E1AUD]
~z~Ouch.

[E1E1_B3V1_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Anyway, what I'm asking is, what's the deal with this music you put out and the branded clothing and shit? 
[E1E1_B3V1_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~It's just part of our vibe man, roll with it.
[E1E1_B3V1_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~The vibe?
[E1E1_B3V1_7:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yeah, man. The vibe. It's how we do. You know we a complete subculture. 
[E1E1_B3V1_9:E1E1AUD]
~z~Like you guys used to be. Back in about what, '63 or something?
[E1E1_B3V1_11:E1E1AUD]
~z~Completely fucking lost, if you ask me.
[E1E1_B3V1_13:E1E1AUD]
~z~We've still got heart, man. The Lost MC are still here. We just don't get on MeTV and scream about it.
[E1E1_B3V1_15:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yeah, sure you are. Whatever you say, Johnny boy.

[E1E1_B1V2_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yo, Johnny boy, I got a question for you, if you got the inclination to answer.
[E1E1_B1V2_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Shoot, Malc.
[E1E1_B1V2_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~What's up with you guys and the Angels of Death?
[E1E1_B1V2_7:E1E1AUD]
~z~There's a war. Stupid shit, but very violent.
[E1E1_B1V2_9:E1E1AUD]
~z~"There's a war." You sounding all dramatic and shit.
[E1E1_B1V2_11:E1E1AUD]
~z~Well, it's serious business. I lost a lot of brothers. Killed a lot of men, too.
[E1E1_B1V2_13:E1E1AUD]
~z~My bust. I didn't mean to make light of that Johnny.

[E1E1_B2V2_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Oh aight, so, like, it's like one of those gang wars they have out there in Los Santos, or something?
[E1E1_B2V2_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~I guess, a bit.
[E1E1_B2V2_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~Cause, man, I mean - I met some of these Angels of Death and they're some real unfortunate sons-a-bitches.
[E1E1_B2V2_7:E1E1AUD]
~z~Racism, misogyny, bad personal hygiene. But still, why you wanna kill each other?
[E1E1_B2V2_9:E1E1AUD]
~z~It's the personal hygiene thing. We're real sticklers for cleanliness in The Lost MC.
[E1E1_B2V2_11:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yeah, I can tell with them clean crisp threads you wearing, Johnny.

[E1E1_B2V3_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Joking aside, man. Is this shit worth it?
[E1E1_B2V3_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Man, I don't know. What is worth it? Sticking our heads out to steal a truck of blow for a few thousand bucks? 
[E1E1_B2V3_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~I don't know. The alternative seems kind of lame too. Going straight.
[E1E1_B2V3_7:E1E1AUD]
~z~I guess. But...
[E1E1_B2V3_9:E1E1AUD]
~z~Yeah, alright, alright. Let's drop it.
[E1E1_B2V3_11:E1E1AUD]
~z~No doubt, drop that bitch like she hot. The bitch has dropped.

[E1E1_RRDIE_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~This ain't happening, Liz. We're a man down.
[E1E1_RRDIE_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Well, with these cops sniffing around we might all be gone soon. 
[E1E1_RRDIE_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~Maybe he's the lucky one. So long, Johnny.

[E1E1_TRUCK_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Got some bad news, Liz. That van ain't going anywhere. Sorry.
[E1E1_TRUCK_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Ha ha. Don't think I would have been on the outside long enough to sell it anyway. Don't get arrested, Johnny.

[E1E1_CBACK_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Let me guess, you need help.
[E1E1_CBACK_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Man, Clay, you psychic or something? But this will be worth your while, Brother.

[E1E1_TBACK_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Jonathan. Need a hand?
[E1E1_TBACK_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~I do, I do. There's a van that's in the wrong hands, if you catch my drift.
[E1E1_TBACK_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~Well, we should do something about that. See you soon.

[E1E1_TROUB_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Clay, I've run into some trouble on the East Borough bridge.
[E1E1_TROUB_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~Shit, man. Always carry exact change. I'll be there soon.

[E1E1_TROUB2_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~Couple of friends and I are in a fix, Terry. You down?

[E1E1_AA_29:E1E1AUD]

[E1E1_CAGE_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~We best use a car here, brother. Come on.

[E1E1_BIKES_01:E1E1AUD]

[E1E1_BIKES_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~Can you get your people to bring our bikes to the drop-off?
[E1E1_BIKES_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~Dude, can one of your people bring the bikes around? 

[E1E1_MAL1_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~This is one serious gun, amigo. This what they call a street sweeper? 
[E1E1_MAL1_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~That's about accurate for this shit. It'll carve through any motherfuckers dumb enough to stand down wind of us. 
[E1E1_MAL1_5:E1E1AUD]
~z~No doubt.
[E1E1_MAL1_7:E1E1AUD]
~z~I'm guessing Liz wants this convoy hit like a fucking freight train if this is the firepower she's dishing out.
[E1E1_MAL1_9:E1E1AUD]
~z~Should be interesting. 

[E1E1_MAL2_1:E1E1AUD]
~z~It's good to roll with you, Malc. Not that we know each other too well. 
[E1E1_MAL2_3:E1E1AUD]
~z~But you can't be a bigger mope than the last two fuckups Liz Torres had me partying with.
[E1E1_MAL2_5:E1E1AUD]

[E1R1_GAGS_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~Malc, man, you look good in that booth. You should think about a second career.
[E1R1_GAGS_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~What is it about sitting in little booths and wearing uniforms that turns guys into assholes?
[E1R1_GAGS_03:E1E1AUD]
~z~Good thing that little family didn't come through here five minutes later.

[E1R1_WHISP_01:E1E1AUD]
~z~We just need the shipment, okay?
[E1R1_WHISP_02:E1E1AUD]
~z~The shipment's the target.

~z~They reminded me too much of you.
[E1R2_FAIL_7:E1R2AUD]

[E1R2_PASS_7:E1R2AUD]
~z~You better not be pulling nothing, Johnny. Or I'll start pulling your fucking teeth. You hear me?
[E1R2_PASS_9:E1R2AUD]

[E1FCC3_AHLD_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~How 'bout that, brother? An air hockey tie. Is that normal?

[E1FCC3_AHLL_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~I used to play air hockey on base. Don't feel ashamed, man.
[E1FCC3_AHLL_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Power and speed, man. That's what you need to win at air hockey. That's what you're lacking.

[E1FCC3_AHLA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~I don't like to stop before it's finished, man. I never walk away without satisfaction.
[E1FCC3_AHLA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~That's disappointing, man. I was about to slot some goals past you.

[E1FCC3_ALDR_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Fucking air hockey, man. It's a chump's game.
[E1FCC3_ALDR_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~All I could think about back there was little mattress thrashers. You think they like a man who can handle a puck?

[E1FCC3_DLW_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~You can hit a dart board, good for you. Who you think's better with a hunting rifle?
[E1FCC3_DLW_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Winning at darts ain't like winning a prize for physics so I don't wanna hear you running your damn mouth about it.

[E1FCC3_DLD_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~There weren't no winner there. Maybe there shoulda been.
[E1FCC3_DLD_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~I was just playing with you, Johnny. I could have clocked out if I'd wanted to.

[E1FCC3_DLL_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~You see the technique. I throw them darts perfectly, don't I?
[E1FCC3_DLL_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Perfect aim. I've always been blessed with it, man. One of my many gifts.

[E1FCC3_DLA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Shit, it don't feel right not clocking out. Like turning off the game at half time.
[E1FCC3_DLA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Well, brother, if you can't handle me beatin' ya...

[E1FCC3_DLDR_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~I don't trust myself with those things. I'm f-f-f-fucking take someone's eye out.
[E1FCC3_DLDR_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Whoa. What were we doing in there? I remember play darts? That right?

[E1FCC3_PLW_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Shit, Johnny, you must be proud, you can sink a few balls. Great.
[E1FCC3_PLW_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~So, you exploited a lucky break. There wasn't much I could do from the outset.

[E1FCC3_PLD_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Dead heat, man. Stale mate. That's it, man.
[E1FCC3_PLD_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~You held me to a draw, man. Not many brothers could boast that. Well done.

[E1FCC3_PLL_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Tell me, Johnny, what was your favorite shot of mine.I didn't even do any tricks. Maybe next time.
[E1FCC3_PLL_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Class is out, brother. Tell your daddy what you learned today.

[E1FCC3_PLA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Well If you ain't gonna finish something, why you start in the first place?
[E1FCC3_PLA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~I believe they now call what you got A.D.H.D., in my day it was called being a pain in the ass.

[E1FCC3_PLDR_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Fucking pool, man. Pool and pussy - my two favorite things.
[E1FCC3_PLDR_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Alright, man. Nows gotta be time to go find some mattress thrashers.

[E1FCC3_SHLW_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Well, at least we laughed. 
[E1FCC3_SHLW_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Laughter becomes all the more valuable as this fucked up world gets more and more perverse.

[E1FCC3_SHLA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~I think they can prescribe some mild amphetamines for your attention disorder, John. 
[E1FCC3_SHLA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Where's the fire, Johnny? Some bad shit better have gone down to justify my losing out on the ticket price.

[E1FCC3_SHLD_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Ha ha ha ha. When the next show.
[E1FCC3_SHLD_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~I-I was looking at that guy on stage, man. I ain't gay, but he was kinda cute.

[E1FCC3_LPFA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~One more shot! One more shot!
[E1FCC3_LPFA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Where the bitches at, man? Let's go find the bitches!

[E1FCC3_LPG_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Alright, brothers. It's on. It's on. Lock up your daughters, Clay is on the prowl.
[E1FCC3_LPG_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~We are refreshed and the city is our playground. Where the playmates at?

[E1FCC3_LPA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Glad to get outta there, man. Where's the real party at?
[E1FCC3_LPA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~What was with that place, man? I know you drunk now, but you didn't have that excuse goin' in.

[E1FCC3_LPF_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~You think those boys minded my conversing with their ladies?
[E1FCC3_LPF_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~You just angry cause your bitch want me.
[E1FCC3_LPF_03:E1FCC3A]
~z~What can I do, I'm blessed. It ain't my fault your woman sees this shit and wants it.
[E1FCC3_LPF_04:E1FCC3A]
~z~We The Lost MC. We ain't gonna lie down and take it. Maybe your girl will...

[E1FCC3_LPFT_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~I'm an army man. Be warned.
[E1FCC3_LPFT_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~I learned all kind of crazy Kung Fu shit out East.
[E1FCC3_LPFT_03:E1FCC3A]
~z~Yeah, I'm drunk, but I can still swing a punch, chump.
[E1FCC3_LPFT_04:E1FCC3A]
~z~This how The Lost MC handle themselves.
[E1FCC3_LPFT_05:E1FCC3A]
~z~Someone tells these fools who they messin' with.
[E1FCC3_LPFT_06:E1FCC3A]
~z~Bring it right here.
[E1FCC3_LPFT_07:E1FCC3A]
~z~I got to close one eye to see you, but I'll still beat your ass.
[E1FCC3_LPFT_08:E1FCC3A]
~z~Come on then. Where you at?

[E1FCC3_LEF_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~That was good feedin'.
[E1FCC3_LEF_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~I ain't hungry no more.

[E1FCC3_LEG_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Good food, shame about the company. Ha ha ha.
[E1FCC3_LEG_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Just like my momma used to microwave and put on the kitchen table. 

[E1FCC3_LEA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Well, we ate.
[E1FCC3_LEA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Don't know what was worse, the food or looking at your ugly face, man.

[E1FCC3_ELD_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~More food. I'm still hungry, man.
[E1FCC3_ELD_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~I'm gonna throw this shit up. I ain't joking.

[E1FCC3_STLW_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~You see the way those girls were looking at me? They woulda paid this guy for a private dance, I'm telling you that.
[E1FCC3_STLW_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~You shoulda seen some of the gentleman's clubs in Thailand, brother. No touchin' rules out there.

[E1FCC3_STLA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~You depriving those girls of any chance at real happiness by taking me away from that place.
[E1FCC3_STLA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Shit, Johnny. Were you jealous of the way them girls looked at me? It's a gift, man. It's a gift.

[E1FCC3_STLD_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~I'm going back in. I'm taking her home with me.
[E1FCC3_STLD_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Case and point. I need a woman I can do everything with. Shit, I'm gonna spew.

[E1FCC3_AWLW_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~You were, like, bending your wrist, man.
[E1FCC3_AWLW_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~You been juicing, Johnny. No way you beat me without chemical assistance.

[E1FCC3_AWLL_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Sweet of you to try, Johnny. But that little arm of yours ain't nothing to Big Clay.
[E1FCC3_AWLL_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Try as you might, Johnny, you can't move the rock.

[E1FCC3_AWLF_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~You forfeit means I win. Too bad, Johnny.
[E1FCC3_AWLF_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Brother, was I hurting you? That why you quit?

[E1FCC3_AWLA_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Shit, I didn't mean to intimidate you.
[E1FCC3_AWLA_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~That's right, man. Maybe you should try one of the smaller brothers. Maybe even a club momma.

[E1FCC3_AWLD_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~Fuckin' yeah, man. I'm strong, ain't I?
[E1FCC3_AWLD_02:E1FCC3A]
~z~Lost MC, man. We're fucking brothers. Brothers that arm wrestle.

[E1FCC3_CLW_01:E1FCC3A]
~z~I got bad cards, man.

[E1FCT_AH_01:E1FCTA]
~z~How do you feel about a game of air hockey?
[E1FCT_AH_02:E1FCTA]
~z~So...me, you, air hockey...what d'ya say?
[E1FCT_AH_03:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm bored, man. Wanna play some air hockey?
[E1FCT_AH_04:E1FCTA]
~z~What's going on? You wanna play some air hockey?

[E1FCT_AHY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Air hockey? Sure. Why not? Look, can you pick me up in the next two hours?
[E1FCT_AHY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Sure, brother. I'm down. It'll have to be soon, though.
[E1FCT_AHY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~Yeah, why not? Nothing going on for the next couple of hours. Come pick me up.
[E1FCT_AHY_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Air hockey? Shit, reminds me of the 1980s. Sure, I'll play. The sooner the better, though.

[E1FCT_ACC_01:E1FCTA]
~z~OK, see you soon then.
[E1FCT_ACC_02:E1FCTA]
~z~That's what I like to hear. See you soon.
[E1FCT_ACC_03:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm on my way.
[E1FCT_ACC_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Cool, I'll see you soon.
[E1FCT_ACC_05:E1FCTA]
~z~Sounds good. See you soon.
[E1FCT_ACC_06:E1FCTA]

[E1FCT_ACC_07:E1FCTA]
~z~Sure thing, brother. See you soon.
[E1FCT_ACC_08:E1FCTA]
~z~OK, wait for me. I'll be there soon.

[E1FCT_IR_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Shit, Johnny. Where have you been hiding?
[E1FCT_IR_02:E1FCTA]
~z~I thought you must have lost my number, bro.

[E1FCT_VIR_01:E1FCTA]
~z~I haven't heard shit from you in days.
[E1FCT_VIR_02:E1FCTA]
~z~I thought you'd dropped off the radar.

[E1FCT_ACTN_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Things are crazy now, Johnny. Maybe another time.
[E1FCT_ACTN_02:E1FCTA]
~z~I can't, brother. Too much going on right now.
[E1FCT_ACTN_03:E1FCTA]
~z~The way thing's are going today I'd lose for sure. Another time.
[E1FCT_ACTN_04:E1FCTA]
~z~No time right now, man. Maybe later.
[E1FCT_ACTN_05:E1FCTA]
~z~Sorry man. So much going on right now, I barely got time to take a crap.
[E1FCT_ACTN_06:E1FCTA]
~z~I can't face it now, Johnny. I'm having a bad fucking day.

[E1FCT_REJ_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Fair enough. I'll give you a shout later.
[E1FCT_REJ_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Your call, man. I'll speak to you later.
[E1FCT_REJ_03:E1FCTA]
~z~It was only an idea. I'll catch you later.

[E1FCT_LILO_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Fuck Johnny, sure, we can hang out. But, shit, brother, you've gotta keep in touch. I thought you were dead or something.
[E1FCT_LILO_02:E1FCTA]
~z~The elusive Johnny Klebitz. A rare fucking honor. Sure, I'm free. Come pick me up.

[E1FCT_SLP_1:E1FCTA]
~z~Fuck man. Do you know what time it is? Call me back after eleven.

[E1FCT_WKUP_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Shit, sorry man. I'll call back later.
[E1FCT_WKUP_02:E1FCTA]
~z~OK, take it easy. You work on that right forearm of yours and we'll speak later.

[E1FCT_APH_1:E1FCTA]
~z~This is Terry. Leave a message and I'll call you back.

[E1FCT_DT_01:E1FCTA]
~z~What are you doing? You wanna play darts?
[E1FCT_DT_02:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm thinking of throwing a few darts at a wall. Wanna join me?
[E1FCT_DT_03:E1FCTA]
~z~Listen, why don't we go for a game of darts?
[E1FCT_DT_04:E1FCTA]
~z~I was thinking it's about time I beat you at darts again. What d'ya say?

[E1FCT_DTY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Yeah, why not?
[E1FCT_DTY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Sure, I'll play. Beats sitting here alone with my thoughts. Let's make it soon, though.
[E1FCT_DTY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~Let's do it, man. Can you be here in the next couple of hours?

[E1FCT_GW_01:E1FCTA]
~z~What are you up to? What d'ya say we throw a surprise party for the Deadbeats?
[E1FCT_GW_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Listen, man. I've had just about enough of those Deadbeats. We need to show them what happens to people who fuck with us.
[E1FCT_GW_03:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm done with all this pussying around. I say we hit the Deadbeats right now.
[E1FCT_GW_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Those Angels Of Death cocksuckers are up to something, man. We need to go at them hard. And I mean now.

[E1FCT_GWY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Music to my ears, brother. I'll get a crew together. Meet me as soon as you can.
[E1FCT_GWY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Damn right, brother. Let me make a few phone calls. Can you get over here in the next hour or two?
[E1FCT_GWY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm with you, Johnny. Make it soon, though. Before the boys are too drunk. 
[E1FCT_GWY_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Hell yes. Get over here as soon as you can. I'll set everything up.

[E1FCT_P_01:E1FCTA]
~z~It's about time I schooled your ass on the pool table.
[E1FCT_P_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Are you busy? Wanna game of pool?
[E1FCT_P_03:E1FCTA]
~z~What are doing, bro? You down to play some pool?
[E1FCT_P_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Why don't we go and play some pool somewhere?

[E1FCT_PY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~You must be a glutton for punishment, man. Let's do it. Come pick me up.
[E1FCT_PY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Yeah, I know how you like to drop your balls. Sure, I'll play. Can you get here in the next hour or two?
[E1FCT_PY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~Yeah, I think I can free up a window in my schedule for an ass-kicking. Swing by and pick me up now.

[E1FCT_R_01:E1FCTA]
~z~I need to blow off some steam, brother. Do you want to do some racing?
[E1FCT_R_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Listen man. I'm thinking it's about time we had ourselves a race.
[E1FCT_R_03:E1FCTA]
~z~I hear you been talking about how fast you are. Well, I want to see these new-found balls of yours.
[E1FCT_R_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Are you ready for your next driving lesson? I want to race, man.

[E1FCT_RY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~It's always a pleasure to wipe the smile off your face. Meet me as soon as you can.
[E1FCT_RY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~I could beat you on a pushbike, Klebitz. Get over here and I'll show you how it's done.
[E1FCT_RY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~Sure thing, brother. You know me. Can you get here in the next two hours?
[E1FCT_RY_04:E1FCTA]
~z~The pizza delivery guy's faster than you, Klebitz. I'm definitely in. Come meet me here.

[E1FCT_SH_01:E1FCTA]
~z~I need some mindless entertainment of a non-sexual kind. You wanna go see a show?
[E1FCT_SH_02:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm gonna go check out a show. Do you wanna come?
[E1FCT_SH_03:E1FCTA]
~z~This sounds weird, I know, but do you want to go see a show with me?
[E1FCT_SH_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Do you want to see a show? We don't need tell the boys.

[E1FCT_SHY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Sure, it's about time I did something other than get wasted. Pick me up in the next two hours.
[E1FCT_SHY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Show could mean anything coming from you but, fuck, yeah, I'm in. Come pick me up.
[E1FCT_SHY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~OK, but I'm not holding your hand. Pick me up in the next couple of hours.

[E1FCT_DR_01:E1FCTA]
~z~What are you doing? Do you wanna go out and get smashed?
[E1FCT_DR_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Listen, I've got a serious thirst on me now. Why don't we go get some drinks?
[E1FCT_DR_03:E1FCTA]
~z~My liver hasn't been pummelled for a good few hours. What d'ya say we go for a beer or two?
[E1FCT_DR_04:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm thinking of getting a few strong ones in me. Take the edge off. You wanna join me?

[E1FCT_DRY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Is the sky fucking blue? Of course, man. Come pick me up.
[E1FCT_DRY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Have I ever said no? Let's tear it up, brother. I'll wait here for you.
[E1FCT_DRY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~What do you think?! Get over here and pick me up.
[E1FCT_DRY_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Hair of the dog is just what the doctor ordered. Come and get me.

[E1FCT_E_01:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm starving, man. You wanna go get some food?
[E1FCT_E_02:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm gonna grab some food. Do you wanna come?
[E1FCT_E_03:E1FCTA]
~z~You wanna get some food? Even a skinny dude like you's gotta eat.
[E1FCT_E_04:E1FCTA]
~z~I could eat a nun's ass through a wicker chair right now. Do you wanna get something to eat?

[E1FCT_EY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Sure thing, brother. I can't even remember the last time I ate. Come get me.
[E1FCT_EY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~So long as there's red meat involved, yeah I'm in. Come get me.
[E1FCT_EY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~Why not; I need something to line the stomach. Swing by and pick me up.
[E1FCT_EY_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Hell yeah man. Definitely, let's eat. It'll have to be in the next couple of hours, though.

[E1FCT_ST_01:E1FCTA]
~z~What are you up to? Wanna go look at some tits?
[E1FCT_ST_02:E1FCTA]
~z~OK, I'm gonna say two words to you... strip and club.
[E1FCT_ST_03:E1FCTA]
~z~You, me, a bunch of naked chicks in glass stilettos. What do you say?
[E1FCT_ST_04:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm thinking of investing in some female company. Do you wanna join me?

[E1FCT_STY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~You read my mind, Johnny. Get over here in the next couple of hours, if you can.
[E1FCT_STY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~All my plans have just been cancelled. Pick me up as soon as you can.
[E1FCT_STY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~No, no, that's degrading to women...of course, man. Come pick me up.
[E1FCT_STY_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Yeah, let's go argue with some lap dancers over the touching rule. I'll wait here for you.

[E1FCT_H_01:E1FCTA]
~z~What are you up to? You want to check out what's going on at the clubhouse?
[E1FCT_H_02:E1FCTA]
~z~I'm heading over the clubhouse. You wanna come?
[E1FCT_H_03:E1FCTA]
~z~You busy? I'm thinking of going to the clubhouse.
[E1FCT_H_04:E1FCTA]
~z~You wanna hang out at the clubhouse?

[E1FCT_HY_01:E1FCTA]
~z~Sure. Nothing else going on. I'll meet you there.
[E1FCT_HY_02:E1FCTA]
~z~Why not? See you there.
[E1FCT_HY_03:E1FCTA]
~z~Good idea. Count me in. I'll meet you there.
[E1FCT_HY_04:E1FCTA]
~z~Yeah, sounds like a plan. See you there.


{E1FCT2 Terry calls Player}

[E1FCT2_AHF_1:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny, what's going on? Do you wanna go hang out, play some air hockey?

[E1FCT2_AHY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Air hockey? Not quite what I was expecting but, sure, why not...I'll swing by and pick you up.
[E1FCT2_AHY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Er, ok, Terry. I suppose I could have a quick game. I'll pick you up in the next hour or two.

[E1FCT2_ACC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sounds good, brother. See you soon.
[E1FCT2_ACC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Great. See you later.
[E1FCT2_ACC_03:E1FCT2A]
~z~Nice one, Johnny. See you soon.
[E1FCT2_ACC_04:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'll wait here. See you later.

[E1FCT2_AHN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sorry, Terry, air hockey's pretty far down my priority list right now. Maybe some other time.
[E1FCT2_AHN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~That's creepy, Terry. Sounds like you're asking me on a date. Anyway I can't right now. Maybe another time.

[E1FCT2_REJ_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~No problem. Give me a call when you've got time to hang out.
[E1FCT2_REJ_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sure thing, Johnny, call me when you've got some free time.
[E1FCT2_REJ_03:E1FCT2A]
~z~OK, give me a call when you're free.
[E1FCT2_REJ_04:E1FCT2A]
~z~Yeah, it doesn't have to be right now. If you're bored later, give me a call.

[E1FCT2_GRT_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny, it's Terry.
[E1FCT2_GRT_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~What's going on, Johnny? It's Terry.
[E1FCT2_GRT_03:E1FCT2A]
~z~Johnny. This is Terry.
[E1FCT2_GRT_04:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey brother, it's me.

[E1FCT2_AH_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Have you got plans? Do you wanna play some air hockey?
[E1FCT2_AH_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~What are you up to? Have you got time for a game of air hockey?

[E1FCT2_IR_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Johnny, where have you been? You need to check in, man. You've got a lot of enemies out there.
[E1FCT2_IR_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey, it's Terry. Have you forgotten how to use your phone? I can't watch your back if I don't know where you are.

[E1FCT2_VIR_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey, it's Terry. I don't know if you remember me but we used to be brothers at one point. Why the fuck haven't you called, man?
[E1FCT2_VIR_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Johnny, you'd better have a very good reason for this wall of fucking silence you've been putting up.

[E1FCT2_DF_1:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny, it's Terry. Do you wanna meet up? Play some darts or something?

[E1FCT2_DY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sure man. I'll sling a few arrows with you. Wait there - I'll come pick you up.
[E1FCT2_DY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Yeah, why not. Darts is my game, brother. I'll pick you up in the next hour or two.

[E1FCT2_D_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Do you wanna go play some darts?
[E1FCT2_D_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Are you busy? Feel like a game of darts?

[E1FCT2_DN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sorry man. Another time. Other shit to deal with right now. 
[E1FCT2_DN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'm not in the mood right now, Terry. Maybe another time.

[E1FCT2_GF_1:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny, what's going on? Do you wanna go fuck with some Deadbeats?

[E1FCT2_GY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Best idea I've heard all day. Stay there and I'll pick you up.
[E1FCT2_GY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~You're talking my language, Terry. I'll be over in the next hour or two.

[E1FCT2_G_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~We've gotta do something about these AOD bitches, man. I say we hit back, right now.
[E1FCT2_G_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Brother, those Deadbeats just aren't getting the message. It's about time we took the war to them.

[E1FCT2_GN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Now's not the time, Terry. Hang tight, brother. We'll get those motherfuckers soon.
[E1FCT2_GN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~There's too much going on right now. It don't feel right. Let's wait a while.

[E1FCT2_PF_1:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey, it's Terry. Do you wanna go shoot some pool?

[E1FCT2_PY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sure, I'm always keen to extend my unbeaten run. I'll come pick you up.
[E1FCT2_PY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Yeah, I got some free time. I'll come over now.

[E1FCT2_P_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny, are you down for a game of pool?
[E1FCT2_P_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~It's Terry. Do you wanna shoot some pool?

[E1FCT2_PN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'm tied up right now, bro. Hit me up another time.
[E1FCT2_PN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~I can't right now, man. I've got too much shit on my plate.

[E1FCT2_RY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~A race? Too fucking right. I'm in, man. I'll be there as soon as I can.
[E1FCT2_RY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~You thought right, my man. Can you wait for me there? I can be there in an hour, maybe two.

[E1FCT2_R_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~OK, Klebitz. There's a race happening. Are you in?
[E1FCT2_R_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Right, cancel all your plans. We've got some racing to do.

[E1FCT2_RN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~I've bruised enough egos for one day. Another time.
[E1FCT2_RN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'll give someone else a chance this time. There's other shit I gotta do right now.

[E1FCT2_SHF_1:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny, are you doing anything? Do you want to go watch a show?

[E1FCT2_SHY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Nothing much going on, man, so why not. I'll come over and pick you up.
[E1FCT2_SHY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~I didn't have you pegged as a cultural dude, Terry. Yeah, I'll go to a show. Give me an hour or two.

[E1FCT2_SH_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny, have you got time to go to a show?
[E1FCT2_SH_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~It's Terry. Listen, man, I'm thinking of going to a show. Do you want to come?

[E1FCT2_SHN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Right now, I couldn't think of anything worse. Give me a call later.
[E1FCT2_SHN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~What, like theatre shit? No way, dude. If I wanted to see men in spandex kissing, I'd watch pro wrestling. 

[E1FCT2_DRF_1:E1FCT2A]
~z~It's Terry. Listen, are you feeling thirsty? I reckon there's a few shots of whiskey with our names on them.

[E1FCT2_DRY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'm always thirsty, bro. I'll come over and pick you up. Give me an hour or two.
[E1FCT2_DRY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~I was sold as soon as you said whisky, man. Wait there. I'll come pick you up.

[E1FCT2_DR_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny, wanna get loaded and hit on some college chicks?
[E1FCT2_DR_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey man. Where are you? I vote we get stuck into a session. What d'ya say?

[E1FCT2_DRN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'd love to, man, but I've gotta try to keep my head straight right now. Another time.
[E1FCT2_DRN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~I never thought I'd say this but... no... I can't right now. I've got some other shit I've gotta deal with.

[E1FCT2_EF_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny. What are you up to? Do you wanna grab something to eat?
[E1FCT2_EF_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~It's Terry. Listen, man, I'm just heading out to get some food. Do you wanna join?

[E1FCT2_EY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Why not. A man can't live on pussy alone. I'll pass by and pick you up.
[E1FCT2_EY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~That's a good idea, bro. I'm fucking famished. Wait there for me and I'll be over as soon as I can.

[E1FCT2_E_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny. Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat?
[E1FCT2_E_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey man. It's Terry. Have you eaten? Wanna grab some food?

[E1FCT2_EN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~No thanks, man. I know the places you like to eat and I can't afford to spend a week on the can right now.
[E1FCT2_EN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~I can't at the moment, Terry. Maybe later. 

[E1FCT2_STF_1:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey, it's Terry. Listen I've got a plan. It involves tits, thongs and over-priced alcohol. Are you interested?

[E1FCT2_STY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~That's an offer I can not refuse. Wait for me there, man. I'll drop by and pick you up.
[E1FCT2_STY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~You're a born salesman, Terry. Count me in. I'll pick you in the next two hours.

[E1FCT2_ST_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey, it's Terry. How do you feel about a pair of nipples bouncing on either side of your nose?
[E1FCT2_ST_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Johnny. What d'ya think about spending some of our hard-earned money on some adult entertainment?

[E1FCT2_STN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sorry man. I got tits of another kind to deal with right now. Another time for sure.
[E1FCT2_STN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~It's a tempting offer, my man, but I can't right now. Give Fantasia my regards.

[E1FCT2_HF_1:E1FCT2A]
~z~Johnny, it's Terry. I'm gonna hang out at the clubhouse for a while, if you're interested?

[E1FCT2_HY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Yeah, I could do with some chilling out. Give me an hour or two and I'll meet you there.
[E1FCT2_HY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Definitely - that sounds good. I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

[E1FCT2_CH_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~What's going on, Johnny? Do you wanna hang at the clubhouse for a while?
[E1FCT2_CH_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey, it's Terry. I'm heading over the clubhouse if you wanna come?

[E1FCT2_CHN_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Man I can't face that whole scene right now. Maybe another time.
[E1FCT2_CHN_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sorry, bro. I'm too busy right now. I'll catch you later.

[E1FCT2_AHC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Listen bro. Sorry, I'm not gonna be able to make it.
[E1FCT2_AHC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Terry, we'll have to do battle on the air hockey table another time. Something's come up, man.

[E1FCT2_HI_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Don't worry about it, man. Plenty more opportunities.
[E1FCT2_HI_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~No problem, brother. We can do it another time.

[E1FCT2_MED_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Yeah, yeah. Whatever, man. Another time.
[E1FCT2_MED_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sure, I guess. You've gotta do what you've gotta do.

[E1FCT2_LO_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~It's not right to fuck with a brother like this, Johnny.
[E1FCT2_LO_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Why doesn't that surprise me?! You're so full of shit, Johnny.

[E1FCT2_DC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Terry. I'm not gonna be able to play darts, man. I've got some urgent business to attend to.
[E1FCT2_DC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Listen man. I know it's late notice but I'm gonna have to bail on the darts.

[E1FCT2_GWC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~This doesn't feel right, Terry. I'm backing out of this one.
[E1FCT2_GWC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Terry. Something else has come up. The Deadbeats can wait. 

[E1FCT2_PC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Terry, I'm gonna have to give the pool a miss, man. Sorry.
[E1FCT2_PC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Listen man, something's come up. I'll have to hustle you some other time.

[E1FCT2_RC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'm not gonna be able to make it, Terry. We'll have to race another time.
[E1FCT2_RC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey man, I can't make that race. Some unexpected shit has just landed on my plate.

[E1FCT2_SHC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Listen man. I'm kinda having second thoughts about this whole show idea. Let's do it another time.
[E1FCT2_SHC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Some shit just slammed into the fan, bro. I'm not gonna be able to make it to the show.

[E1FCT2_DRC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Terry, I'm not gonna be able to make it. You'll have to drink by yourself, bro, like you usually do.
[E1FCT2_DRC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'm sorry, man, I'm gonna have to cancel on you. Something came up. Believe me, I'd rather be getting loaded.

[E1FCT2_EC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sorry man, I'm gonna have to take a rain check on the food. 
[E1FCT2_EC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Terry. I can't meet you right now, man. The meal's gonna have to wait.

[E1FCT2_STC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'm gonna have to give the strip club a miss, man. Something urgent's come up. Even more urgent than tits.
[E1FCT2_STC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Sorry man - you'll have to fly solo on this one. There's some other shit I need to deal with.

[E1FCT2_HC_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Hey Terry, I'm not gonna be able to make it to the clubhouse.
[E1FCT2_HC_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~Listen, I'm not gonna be able to meet you at the clubhouse. Last minute change of plan. I'll explain later.

[E1FCT3_PLAY_01:E1FCT2A]
~z~Let's do it.
[E1FCT3_PLAY_02:E1FCT2A]
~z~You're on.
[E1FCT3_PLAY_03:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'm in.
[E1FCT3_PLAY_04:E1FCT2A]
~z~Looking forward to it, man.
[E1FCT3_PLAY_05:E1FCT2A]
~z~Okay, man. You're on.
[E1FCT3_PLAY_06:E1FCT2A]
~z~You got a date, cocksucker.
[E1FCT3_PLAY_07:E1FCT2A]
~z~I'm yours for the night, baby.
[E1FCT3_PLAY_08:E1FCT2A]
~z~Kickass, man. I'm in.


{E1FCT3}

[E1FCT3_AH_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~OK, Johnny. Let's see what you've got.
[E1FCT3_AH_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~OK, Johnny. Let's see if we can awaken those fabled reactions of yours.

[E1FCT3_AHY_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Air hockey?! Not quite what I was expecting, brother, I gotta say. But why not...
[E1FCT3_AHY_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I didn't think we were gonna be playing air hockey but...whatever floats your boat, man.

[E1FCT3_AHD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Let's do this shit, man. I'm a fucking air hockey legend, man.
[E1FCT3_AHD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Fucking air hockey, man. I rule this shit.

[E1FCT3_AD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~OK, Johnny. Let's see how many you can actually get on the board.
[E1FCT3_AD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Right, let's play some darts, brother.

[E1FCT3_DY_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Didn't think we were going to play darts, man. But, hey, when in fucking Rome.
[E1FCT3_DY_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Darts? Where did that sudden inspiration come from? Fuck it, let's play.

[E1FCT3_DD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Yeah darts, baby. First one to pop the barmaid's implants.
[E1FCT3_DD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'm in the fucking zone, man. Steady as a rock.

[E1FCT3_P_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Right then, Klebitz. To the death.
[E1FCT3_P_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Ok Johnny. Let's see those skills you keep going on about.

[E1FCT3_PY_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Where did this sudden change of plan come from? OK, man, pool it is.
[E1FCT3_PY_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~We're going here now? Fine by me. I'm always down for a game of pool.

[E1FCT3_PD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~You best be ready, man. I'm gonna take your ass to school then give it fucking homework.
[E1FCT3_PD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Me playing pool is like poetry in motion, man. It's a fucking beautiful thing.

[E1FCT3_SH_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~This better not be any of that queer arty bullshit.
[E1FCT3_SH_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~This better be good, man. We're cutting into some serious drinking time here. 

[E1FCT3_DSHY_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~You didn't tell me we were going to show, man. Shit, why not. I just hope nobody sees us.
[E1FCT3_DSHY_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~A closet man of the arts? Who'd have thought it? Fuck it, I'll watch a show with you.

[E1FCT3_SHD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Do they sell booze? I ain't stayin' unless they got booze, man.
[E1FCT3_SHD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~There'd better be tits, man. You can't have a show without tits.

[E1FCT3_PF_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I love this place, man. Straight-up beer and bitches. No bullshit, you know?
[E1FCT3_PF_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Man, if I had a dollar for every time I've woken up on the floor of this joint. 

[E1FCT3_PG_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~This place isn't bad, bro. Just don't eat the peanuts on the bar, if you value your lower intestine.
[E1FCT3_PG_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Yeah, this'll do. They serve a half-decent whisky in here.

[E1FCT3_PA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I didn't think this was your kind of place, Johnny. But, fuck it, a drink's a drink.
[E1FCT3_PA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Man, I can't believe you chose this shithole. We're gonna have to get very drunk, very quickly.

[E1FCT3_DRY_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I like your thinking, man. Getting loaded is a much better plan. 
[E1FCT3_DRY_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~A drink? Now you're talking my language, brother.

[E1FCT3_EF_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I love this place, man. They put cheese on everything.
[E1FCT3_EF_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I eat here all the time. Seriously hot waitresses, bro.

[E1FCT3_EG_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Yeah, this place is ok. They're a bit fucking French with their portions, though.
[E1FCT3_EG_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~This'll do, I suppose. We'll be hungry again in another hour, though.

[E1FCT3_EA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~This place? Are you fucking kidding? You must have a cast-iron stomach, man.
[E1FCT3_EA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I can't believe you went for this place. Everything comes with a side order of dysentery.

[E1FCT3_FY_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Good idea, man. This hangover needs feeding.
[E1FCT3_FY_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I like your thinking, Johnny. I could do with some food.

[E1FCT3_FD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Hot sauce, man. I want hot sauce on everything.
[E1FCT3_FD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Stay away from the yellow mayonnaise, man, that's all I'm gonna say.

[E1FCT3_ST_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~OK, man. Let's dry hump some illegal immigrants.
[E1FCT3_ST_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Hold onto your g-strings, ladies. This party has just arrived.

[E1FCT3_STY_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Shit Johnny, you should've told me. I'd have brought more money.
[E1FCT3_STY_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~A strip club? Now you're talking, man!

[E1FCT3_STD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I hope Bambi's here, man. I fucking love Bambi.
[E1FCT3_STD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'm gonna see if I can get us some takeout, man. 

[E1FCT3_AW_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~OK, Johnny. Let's see what you got.
[E1FCT3_AW_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Right man. Let's take this old-school.

[E1FCT3_AWD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~You're gonna get annihilated, bro.
[E1FCT3_AWD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'm stronger than I look, I'm warning ya now.

[E1FCT3_C_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I've got a good feeling about this.
[E1FCT3_C_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Let's hope I get some fucking luck for once.

[E1FCT3_CD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Look at this poker face, man. I'm a closed book.
[E1FCT3_CD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'm gonna clean up in here.

[E1FCT3_DAN_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Sorry man. I'm not in the mood for this right now.
[E1FCT3_DAN_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Listen Johnny. I'm gonna give it a miss. Another time maybe.
[E1FCT3_DAN_03:E1FCT3A]
~z~I can't face this right now, man. Maybe another time.
[E1FCT3_DAN_04:E1FCT3A]
~z~Listen man. I'm gonna bail. I can't handle this right now.

[E1FCT3_AHLW_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~You are one lucky motherfucker, Klebitz.
[E1FCT3_AHLW_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I thought I had that one in the bag, man, I really did.

[E1FCT3_AHLD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~We're gonna have to have a rematch, man.
[E1FCT3_AHLD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I hate ties, man. It's worse than losing.

[E1FCT3_AHLL_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I am on fucking fire today.
[E1FCT3_AHLL_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I bet you've never seen reactions like that before. 

[E1FCT3_AHLA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Come on, man. We could at least have finished the game.
[E1FCT3_AHLA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~What's the rush, bro? Can't we at least finish the game?

[E1FCT3_ALDR_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That is one fucked-up game.
[E1FCT3_ALDR_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I can't believe we were playing air hockey, man.

[E1FCT3_DLW_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Man, I couldn't hit anything today.
[E1FCT3_DLW_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I don't even know why I play this stupid game.

[E1FCT3_DLD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~All square. That was a good match, bro.
[E1FCT3_DLD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~A tie, I can't fucking believe it. I'll have you next time.

[E1FCT3_DLL_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That's what happens when you bring your B-game, Klebitz.
[E1FCT3_DLL_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Did you see that last closeout, man? That was some textbook shit right there.

[E1FCT3_DLA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~We could have finished the game, man.
[E1FCT3_DLA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~We didn't even finish, Johnny. What's with the attitude?

[E1FCT3_DLDR_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I couldn't even see the numbers, man. 
[E1FCT3_DLDR_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Fuck man. I've gotta drain the main vein.

[E1FCT3_PLW_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~You are luckier than a dude with two dicks, Johnny.
[E1FCT3_PLW_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~It's official - I cannot play pool sober.

[E1FCT3_PLD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That was close, man. We'll have to have a rematch.
[E1FCT3_PLD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~That was a good session, bro. We're pretty evenly matched.

[E1FCT3_PLL_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I told you I was good, Johnny.
[E1FCT3_PLL_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Don't worry, man. You did ok for a beginner.

[E1FCT3_PLA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~What's your problem, man? We haven't even finished.
[E1FCT3_PLA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Where's the fucking fire, bro? We could have at least finished the game.

[E1FCT3_PLDR_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That was some midas touch shit back there.
[E1FCT3_PLDR_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~There was definitely something wrong with my cue, man. I'm telling you.

[E1FCT3_SHLW_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That was pretty funny, man.
[E1FCT3_SHLW_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~We should have heckled more, bro.

[E1FCT3_SHLA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Where are you going? It wasn't that bad.
[E1FCT3_SHLA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Shit Johnny. It was just starting to get good.

[E1FCT3_SHLD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I didn't even know what I was laughing at, dude.
[E1FCT3_SHLD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I've got a joke for you...suck my dick.

[E1FCT3_LPF_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That's my kinda bar, bro.
[E1FCT3_LPF_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I fucking love that place, man.

[E1FCT3_LPG_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That place is ok. Talk about cock-heavy, though.
[E1FCT3_LPG_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Yeah, I'm still not sure about that place. I was getting some funny smiles off the barman.

[E1FCT3_LPA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Fuck man. What do they put in that beer? It smells like a dog's ass.
[E1FCT3_LPA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~That place sucks, man. Everything tastes like fucking water.

[E1FCT3_LPFI_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~What do these fools want?
[E1FCT3_LPFI_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Eyes up, brother. We've got company.
[E1FCT3_LPFI_03:E1FCT3A]
~z~Check out these dickheads.
[E1FCT3_LPFI_04:E1FCT3A]
~z~This shit's about to go down, bro.

[E1FCT3_LPFT_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'll fuck you all up.
[E1FCT3_LPFT_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~You're going down.
[E1FCT3_LPFT_03:E1FCT3A]
~z~Fucking pussies.
[E1FCT3_LPFT_04:E1FCT3A]
~z~You've no idea who you're fucking with.
[E1FCT3_LPFT_05:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'll rearrange your face.
[E1FCT3_LPFT_06:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'm gonna feed you your balls, bitch.
[E1FCT3_LPFT_07:E1FCT3A]
~z~You're a fucking joke, man.
[E1FCT3_LPFT_08:E1FCT3A]
~z~Open wide and take it like a whore.

[E1FCT3_LEF_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That what I call a feed, brother. That shit'll set you up for the day.
[E1FCT3_LEF_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'd eat at that place every day if I could. They've got the best-tasting cholesterol in town.

[E1FCT3_LEG_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~That place isn't bad. Just what I needed.
[E1FCT3_LEG_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Not bad, man. Filled a hole.

[E1FCT3_LEA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Why do I get the feeling that the chef's special ingredient is his own DNA?
[E1FCT3_LEA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~It was alright, man, but I reckon we should stay close to a restroom.

[E1FCT3_ELD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I've got a serious food baby, man. Feels like fucking twins in there.
[E1FCT3_ELD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~My mouth tastes like fucking battery acid, dude.

[E1FCT3_STLW_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Those girls are high-quality, man. Tested and everything.
[E1FCT3_STLW_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Fuck the wheel. Silicone is man's greatest invention.

[E1FCT3_STLA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~What the fuck, Johnny? I barely had time to slap an ass.
[E1FCT3_STLA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~You're crazy, man. We could have cleaned up in there.

[E1FCT3_STLD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I wish I could just live in there, dude. Tits for breakfast every day.
[E1FCT3_STLD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I love them all the same, man. Every single one of them.

[E1FCT3_AWLW_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I would have had you if I hadn't got that cramp, Johnny.
[E1FCT3_AWLW_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~You see how greasy my side of the table was?

[E1FCT3_AWLL_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~You just witnessed the perfect fusion of power and technique. 
[E1FCT3_AWLL_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I think we all learned something today.

[E1FCT3_AWLF_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Come on, Johnny. That's weak, man.
[E1FCT3_AWLF_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Shit Johnny. I didn't think you were a quitter.

[E1FCT3_AWLA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Come on, Johnny. Don't be such a pussy.
[E1FCT3_AWLA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~What's the problem, man? Have you grown tits all of a sudden?

[E1FCT3_AWLD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~My arm hasn't got that much exercise since the CNT porn-athon.
[E1FCT3_AWLD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'm gonna feel that in the morning, man.

[E1FCT3_CLW_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Can't do much against that kinda luck, man.
[E1FCT3_CLW_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Shit Johnny. Cleaned me out, bro.

[E1FCT3_CLL_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Thought I'd treat you to a little tactical masterclass.
[E1FCT3_CLL_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~Thank you for your donation to the Terry beer fund, thank you.

[E1FCT3_CLA_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Already? You've gotta be fucking with me, man? We're just getting going.
[E1FCT3_CLA_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~You can't back out on me now. I was about to hit a roll.

[E1FCT3_CLD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Higher. Lower. How the fuck am I supposed to know?
[E1FCT3_CLD_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~That shit's given me a headache, man.

[E1FCT3_QL_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~Listen, man, I'm outta here. See you later.
[E1FCT3_QL_02:E1FCT3A]
~z~I've gotta roll, brother. See you later.
[E1FCT3_QL_03:E1FCT3A]
~z~Hey Johnny, I'm gonna have to bail. We'll speak later.
[E1FCT3_QL_04:E1FCT3A]
~z~It was good hanging out, bro, but I've gotta roll.

[E1FCT3_QLD_01:E1FCT3A]
~z~I'm done with this shit, man. You're a lousy fucking date.

[E12W_C1_11:E12WA]
~z~Always thought I'd be an army man.

[E12W_C3_7:E12WA]

~z~We can start an all inclusive prison gang. Crossing lines. Reachin' out to every creed and color?
[E12W_C3_15:E12WA]
~z~Shit, can we reach out to women as well? Don't think I could do without pussy for fifteen to twenty.

[E12W_C4_1:E12WA]
~z~Clay, dude, where was the best place the army stationed you?
[E12W_C4_3:E12WA]
~z~That's easy - Vietnam. 
[E12W_C4_5:E12WA]
~z~You old, Clay. But you ain't that old.
[E12W_C4_7:E12WA]
~z~Not in the war, dumb ass. I was attached to the embassy.
[E12W_C4_9:E12WA]
~z~Yeah? I thought we fucked up that country to all hell.
[E12W_C4_11:E12WA]
~z~No, man. It's all still there. Still going strong.

~z~But the women are a part of the culture?
[E12W_C4_21:E12WA]
~z~Oh yes indeed.

[E12W_C5_1:E12WA]
~z~I still can't get over it, man.
[E12W_C5_3:E12WA]
~z~What, man?
[E12W_C5_5:E12WA]
~z~That I'm a drug dealing, murdering gang member.
[E12W_C5_7:E12WA]
~z~Dude, you're in The Lost. You're just looking out for your brothers.
[E12W_C5_9:E12WA]
~z~I know... I know... Shit, growing up in the neighborhood.

[E12W_C6_13:E12WA]
~z~Just keep 'em away from my fucking menorah, man. That's all I ask.

[E12W_C7_1:E12WA]

[E12W_C7_3:E12WA]

~z~Pretty shit, man. Only way they could get worse is if you or Clay turned snitch.
[E12W_T1_5:E12WA]
~z~Feds don't need snitches, man. They can pluck conversations outta thin air.
[E12W_T1_7:E12WA]
~z~Really?
[E12W_T1_9:E12WA]
~z~They can tap any phone they wanna. Shit, federal witnesses became obsolete at the turn of the century.
[E12W_T1_11:E12WA]
~z~Alright, then. In that case, I guess things couldn't get any worse than they are right now.

[E12W_T2_1:E12WA]
~z~Johnny! I'm drowning here, man. I dunno.
[E12W_T2_3:E12WA]
~z~Shit, is it them payments to your ex wife? The brothers can help.
[E12W_T2_5:E12WA]
~z~I'm on a fucking treadmill, man. Feel I'm running and if I stop everything goes to shit.
[E12W_T2_7:E12WA]
~z~That's life in twenty first century America, my brother. We woke up in a nightmare.
[E12W_T2_9:E12WA]
~z~Fuck, man. I thought the outlaw life would save me from that shit. 
[E12W_T2_11:E12WA]
~z~Guess you were wrong.

[E12W_T3_1:E12WA]
~z~Johnny, you know what gets me, man?
[E12W_T3_3:E12WA]
~z~Yuppies taking bonuses while workers lose their pensions? 
[E12W_T3_5:E12WA]
~z~The Federal Government monitoring our every move? 
[E12W_T3_7:E12WA]
~z~What gets me is these fucking assholes talking politics like it matters.
[E12W_T3_9:E12WA]
~z~Like the country isn't run by five guys behind the scenes.
[E12W_T3_11:E12WA]
~z~I can see how that pisses you off, man. Fuck it all, I guess. 
[E12W_T3_13:E12WA]
~z~Fuck it all, man. Live true.

[E12W_T4_1:E12WA]
~z~Got any new grievances today, Terrence?
[E12W_T4_3:E12WA]
~z~Same old bills biting me in the ass, man. 
[E12W_T4_5:E12WA]
~z~Shit, brother.
[E12W_T4_7:E12WA]
~z~First the mayor takes away our constitutional right to bear arms...
[E12W_T4_9:E12WA]
~z~You lost that right when you got your first felony, man.
[E12W_T4_11:E12WA]
~z~Then they threaten to repossess my bike...
[E12W_T4_13:E12WA]
~z~They can take everything, but you're still a fucking man, Terry. You got that.
[E12W_T4_15:E12WA]
~z~I'd like to see 'em try and repossess my balls, man. That'll be the day.

[E12W_T5_1:E12WA]
~z~Johnny, man, rip up your fucking credit cards.
[E12W_T5_3:E12WA]
~z~I strictly pay with cash, Terry. Keeps things simple.
[E12W_T5_5:E12WA]
~z~Yeah, well, you ain't got alimony to worry about. Nothing simple about that.
[E12W_T5_7:E12WA]
~z~I believe you, brother.
[E12W_T5_9:E12WA]
~z~Know what the American dream is? The house, the car, the family - that bullshit.
[E12W_T5_11:E12WA]
~z~It's a fucking dream and nothing more.
[E12W_T5_13:E12WA]
~z~It's control man. They make you want that shit so they can trap you.
[E12W_T5_15:E12WA]
~z~Then you're working like a dog - breaking your back - and soon there's nothing left.
[E12W_T5_17:E12WA]
~z~The rich get richer and the poor die. 
[E12W_T5_19:E12WA]
~z~Amen, ain't that the truth.

[E12W_T6_1:E12WA]
~z~Johnny, man, they took the house.
[E12W_T6_3:E12WA]
~z~Your ex's house.
[E12W_T6_5:E12WA]
~z~It was mine, man. I fucking paid those mortgage payments.
[E12W_T6_7:E12WA]
~z~Is the old lady alright?
[E12W_T6_9:E12WA]
~z~Yeah she's moved in with her folks.
[E12W_T6_11:E12WA]
~z~Might do her some good getting shit from her parents after all the crap she gave you.
[E12W_T6_13:E12WA]
~z~Sure, man. Little comfort.

[E12W_T7_1:E12WA]
~z~Terry, what's up?
[E12W_T7_3:E12WA]
~z~Nothing, man, I'm cool.
[E12W_T7_5:E12WA]
~z~That ain't like you.
[E12W_T7_7:E12WA]
~z~I'm feeling the calm of a man whose life can't get any worse. 
[E12W_T7_9:E12WA]
~z~I'm sorry, dude.
[E12W_T7_11:E12WA]
~z~Don't worry, man. It's a zen-like place.

[E12W_RESJ_01:E12WA]
~z~You okay Jim? Anyway, as we were saying.
[E12W_RESJ_02:E12WA]
~z~You're getting too slow as well as too old, buddy. Anyway.
[E12W_RESJ_03:E12WA]
~z~You back with us, dude? What were we saying? Oh yeah...

[E12W_REST_01:E12WA]
~z~Where were we, Terrence.
[E12W_REST_02:E12WA]
~z~Shit, Terry, what were we saying?
[E12W_REST_03:E12WA]
~z~So, ummm, yeah...

[E12W_RESC_01:E12WA]
~z~What were we conversing upon, Clayton...
[E12W_RESC_02:E12WA]
~z~Lost the train of thought there, didn't we, Clay?
[E12W_RESC_03:E12WA]
~z~Think we can resume our conversation. That alright with you, Clay?

[E12W_CJ1_1:E12WA]
~z~I dunno how you do it, Jim. One woman and she drives you fucking crazy?
[E12W_CJ1_3:E12WA]
~z~You'll meet someone, Clay. It'll all make sense.
[E12W_CJ1_5:E12WA]
~z~I don't think so, man. Wouldn't be fair.
[E12W_CJ1_7:E12WA]
~z~Fair? What are you talking about?
[E12W_CJ1_9:E12WA]
~z~I got a gift, man. I'm blessed. 
[E12W_CJ1_11:E12WA]
~z~It's my duty to share this with all the females I can.
[E12W_CJ1_13:E12WA]
~z~Herpes ain't a gift, man. It's a disease. You should keep that shit to yourself.
[E12W_CJ1_15:E12WA]
~z~Ha ha. Fuck you, man.

[E12W_CJ2_1:E12WA]
~z~How's, ahh, life, Jim?
[E12W_CJ2_3:E12WA]
~z~Same old shit. Dodging bullets when I'm out and whatever Jackie can throw at me when I'm home. You?
[E12W_CJ2_5:E12WA]
~z~Oh, I'm good. Real good. Found me somethin' fresh. Nice little mattress thrasher. 
[E12W_CJ2_7:E12WA]
~z~Hey, it don't count if you're paying for it.
[E12W_CJ2_9:E12WA]
~z~Oh, they pay me, brother. They all pay for what I got.
[E12W_CJ2_11:E12WA]
~z~You must have a whole lot of spare food stamps then. Good for you.

[E12W_CJ3_1:E12WA]
~z~Fucking bitch.
[E12W_CJ3_3:E12WA]
~z~Who?
[E12W_CJ3_5:E12WA]
~z~Man, I liked her. Going off with that fucking Deadbeat. Shit!
[E12W_CJ3_7:E12WA]
~z~You got left for a Deadbeat?
[E12W_CJ3_9:E12WA]
~z~Don't laugh about it, man. I'm hurtin'.
[E12W_CJ3_11:E12WA]
~z~Get out there, man. There's hardbellies all over this city looking for a man with your gifts.
[E12W_CJ3_13:E12WA]
~z~Shit, man, you're right. You're right.

[E12W_TJ1_1:E12WA]
~z~How's your crazy brother, T?
[E12W_TJ1_3:E12WA]
~z~Insane.
[E12W_TJ1_5:E12WA]
~z~Still banged up?
[E12W_TJ1_7:E12WA]
~z~Unfortunately not. My daddy's scared he's going to come back to the farm.
[E12W_TJ1_9:E12WA]
~z~I hope not. Hope he heads out west or something.
[E12W_TJ1_11:E12WA]
~z~Yeah, me too.

[E12W_TJ2_1:E12WA]
~z~So my brother showed up.
[E12W_TJ2_3:E12WA]
~z~Really? What happened? Everyone still alive?
[E12W_TJ2_5:E12WA]
~z~Not just alive, born anew.
[E12W_TJ2_7:E12WA]
~z~What the fuck?
[E12W_TJ2_9:E12WA]
~z~Crazy Colin's now a man of God.
[E12W_TJ2_11:E12WA]
~z~Shut up.
[E12W_TJ2_13:E12WA]
~z~For real, man. Fool found God inside and now he's trying to convert anyone in a ten mile radius.
[E12W_TJ2_15:E12WA]
~z~Man, I knew God moved in mysterious ways, but that is fucking perverse.

[E12W_TJ3_1:E12WA]
~z~So Colin, my brother - rang me the other day.
[E12W_TJ3_3:E12WA]
~z~Colin the man of God?
[E12W_TJ3_5:E12WA]
~z~Colin the ex man of God, new man of heroin relapse.
[E12W_TJ3_7:E12WA]
~z~Jesus.
[E12W_TJ3_9:E12WA]
~z~Yes, Jesus. Batshit fucking crazy he is, whole family has gone into hiding.
[E12W_TJ3_11:E12WA]
~z~Man, I'm sorry.
[E12W_TJ3_13:E12WA]
~z~Thanks brother.

[E12W_CT1_1:E12WA]
~z~Terrence?
[E12W_CT1_3:E12WA]
~z~Yes, Clayton.
[E12W_CT1_5:E12WA]
~z~How come I'm always stuck with you? Seems like wherever I go, you're right there next to me.
[E12W_CT1_7:E12WA]
~z~Handicapping.
[E12W_CT1_8:E12WA]
~z~Huh?
[E12W_CT1_9:E12WA]
~z~Yeah, it's a handicapping system. They put the strongest of us with the weakest. Evens us out.
[E12W_CT1_11:E12WA]
~z~Shit, no wonder I spend most my time carrying your ass.
[E12W_CT1_13:E12WA]
~z~Other way round, amigo.

[E12W_CT2_1:E12WA]
~z~This fucking country, man!
[E12W_CT2_3:E12WA]
~z~Don't say nothing about this country, Terry. I fought for this country. My friends died for this country.
[E12W_CT2_5:E12WA]
~z~Alright, man. Then I will rephrase it. The fucking pricks running this country, man.
[E12W_CT2_6:E12WA]
~z~Fuck 'em all, my brother.
[E12W_CT2_8:E12WA]
~z~Yes indeed!

[E12W_CT3_1:E12WA]
~z~You voting, Terry?
[E12W_CT3_3:E12WA]
~z~Yeah, man.
[E12W_CT3_5:E12WA]
~z~Who for?
[E12W_CT3_7:E12WA]
~z~The honey-colored girl. I love America's Next Top Hooker.
[E12W_CT3_9:E12WA]
~z~Much as I like that show, I was talking about politicians not hookers.
[E12W_CT3_11:E12WA]
~z~Same thing man, they all trying to fuck you.
[E12W_CT3_12:E12WA]
~z~Get this guy away from me. Will one of you have a serious fucking conversation?


{E13W}

[E13W_JT1_1:E13WA]
~z~Terry, man, how are you doing?
[E13W_JT1_3:E13WA]
~z~All good, Jim. How are you and Jackie?
[E13W_JT1_5:E13WA]
~z~She's giving me a hard time.
[E13W_JT1_7:E13WA]
~z~Probably wonders why you still hang out with losers like us.
[E13W_JT1_9:E13WA]
~z~Something like that.
[E13W_JT1_11:E13WA]
~z~You can't blame her. I'd worry if my husband was hanging out with a chump like Johnny.
[E13W_JT1_13:E13WA]
~z~Very funny. Fucking comedian. 

[E13W_JT2_1:E13WA]
~z~What bullshit are you getting us into next Johnny?
[E13W_JT2_3:E13WA]
~z~We're going to try and figure out if you've got a brain or not.
[E13W_JT2_5:E13WA]
~z~The smart money is on not.
[E13W_JT2_7:E13WA]
~z~That's pretty funny. I love it when a couple complete each other's thoughts. Real sweet
[E13W_JT2_9:E13WA]
~z~Fuck you, Terry.
[E13W_JT2_10:E13WA]
~z~No, keep the jokes coming man. It's like being in an '80s sit-com hanging out with you. 
[E13W_JT2_12:E13WA]
~z~Yeah. That one about the fat white trash woman who lived in a trailer. 

[E13W_JT3_1:E13WA]
~z~What we gonna do, Jim?
[E13W_JT3_3:E13WA]
~z~What do you mean?
[E13W_JT3_5:E13WA]
~z~I mean, what're we gonna do when Johnny gets himself arrested or killed?
[E13W_JT3_7:E13WA]
~z~Oh, when we're the ones who've gotta get this club out of all that trouble by ourselves?
[E13W_JT3_9:E13WA]
~z~Yup.
[E13W_JT3_11:E13WA]
~z~Shit, I dunno.
[E13W_JT3_13:E13WA]
~z~Fuck. I hope there is an afterlife so I can look down upon you fellas. 
[E13W_JT3_15:E13WA]
~z~It'd be real comedic seeing you fall over trying to wipe your own asses.
[E13W_JT3_17:E13WA]
~z~This is stupid. Nothin's gonna happen to Johnny. He's charmed.
[E13W_JT3_19:E13WA]
~z~I hate to say it, but he is a lucky SOB.
[E13W_JT3_21:E13WA]
~z~If I was lucky I wouldn't be hanging with you dumbasses.

[E13W_JT4_1:E13WA]
~z~This is a real relief, boys.
[E13W_JT4_3:E13WA]
~z~What you talking about, Terrance?
[E13W_JT4_5:E13WA]
~z~Riding with you two. I feel relieved. 
[E13W_JT4_7:E13WA]
~z~Finally took some medication for that yeast infection, did ya?
[E13W_JT4_9:E13WA]
~z~I'm relieved to see that you two ain't fucking each other, is all. 
[E13W_JT4_11:E13WA]
~z~Everyone figured that's what you do when you spend all that alone time together. 
[E13W_JT4_13:E13WA]
~z~Actually, me and Johnny were about to bring you and Clay in on it.
[E13W_JT4_15:E13WA]
~z~You ain't gonna be able to walk for a week, T.
[E13W_JT4_17:E13WA]
~z~I should be so lucky.
[E13W_JT4_19:E13WA]
~z~~s~
[E13W_JT4_21:E13WA]
~z~Oh man, I'm hanging out with a bunch of man-rapists. 

[E13W_JC1_1:E13WA]
~z~Man we got heat all over us, all the time
[E13W_JC1_3:E13WA]
~z~I thought it was cause you're a snitch, Clay.
[E13W_JC1_4:E13WA]
~z~Fuck you, Jim. You shoulda stayed in the army.
[E13W_JC1_6:E13WA]
~z~Marines.
[E13W_JC1_7:E13WA]
~z~Yeah - Jim was a sailor.
[E13W_JC1_9:E13WA]
~z~Marines ain't sailors.
[E13W_JC1_11:E13WA]
~z~So you just like to hang out on boats. But you can't actually sail them?
[E13W_JC1_13:E13WA]
~z~Fuck you. Marines are the best fighting force in the whole military.
[E13W_JC1_15:E13WA]
~z~Which is why they let you go.

[E13W_JC2_1:E13WA]
~z~Jim - how's the wife?
[E13W_JC2_3:E13WA]
~z~Never happier than when she's giving me hell.
[E13W_JC2_5:E13WA]
~z~Way you speak about her, I think Jackie must be in the Angels of Death.
[E13W_JC2_7:E13WA]
~z~Trust me, so do I half the time.
[E13W_JC2_8:E13WA]
~z~Jackie's alright, man. She puts up with a prick like you.
[E13W_JC2_9:E13WA]
~z~Very true.

[E13W_JC3_1:E13WA]
~z~You boys ever thought about taking this club national? Like the AOD.
[E13W_JC3_3:E13WA]
~z~Shit, yeah. We could, like, open a theme park.
[E13W_JC3_5:E13WA]
~z~I ain't talking establishment. I give the finger to that shit. 
[E13W_JC3_6:E13WA]
~z~Just take The Lost across coast, you know?
[E13W_JC3_8:E13WA]
~z~We got enough problems in the Liberty City metropolitan area. 
[E13W_JC3_9:E13WA]
~z~Why we'd wanna open that shit up to the whole nation?
[E13W_JC3_11:E13WA]
~z~I guess I'm just a generous person. I wanna give the gift of brotherhood to the whole US.
[E13W_JC3_13:E13WA]
~z~Try that when you're tired of using your gift for bullshit on us, okay.
[E13W_JC3_14:E13WA]
~z~Alright, man. Okay. I can tell when someone don't want to listen.

[E13W_JC4_1:E13WA]
~z~Guess who I was thinking about today, guys?
[E13W_JC4_3:E13WA]
~z~I don't know. That guy off the TV, Jeremy St. Somethin'? You've always had a crush on him.
[E13W_JC4_5:E13WA]
~z~Funny, but I was thinking of Mickey.
[E13W_JC4_6:E13WA]
~z~We don't fucking talk about Mickey.
[E13W_JC4_8:E13WA]
~z~I know, but...
[E13W_JC4_10:E13WA]
~z~Fuck, Mickey. The fucking snitch.
[E13W_JC4_11:E13WA]
~z~Fine whatever. Let's pretend he don't exist.
[E13W_JC4_13:E13WA]
~z~Trust me, he don't.


{Drunk Conversations}

[E1DR_4W1_1:E1DRA]
~z~How you boys doing?
[E1DR_4W1_3:E1DRA]
~z~Im sober! Let's have another drink.
[E1DR_4W1_4:E1DRA]
~z~You don't look sober, old man.
[E1DR_4W1_6:E1DRA]
~z~No, you look fucked up.
[E1DR_4W1_8:E1DRA]
~z~But that may just be the age.
[E1DR_4W1_9:E1DRA]
~z~Fuck all of you. Fucking assholes.

[E1DR_4W2_1:E1DRA]
~z~Lost MC. Fucking Lost Motorcycle Club, man.
[E1DR_4W2_3:E1DRA]
~z~Lost MC! Lost M fucking C. Yeah!
[E1DR_4W2_5:E1DRA]
~z~Oh yeah, Lost MC.
[E1DR_4W2_7:E1DRA]
~z~Well, if everyone else's doin' it. Here's a Lost MC for ya.
[E1DR_4W2_9:E1DRA]
~z~I love you, brothers. I fucking love you.

[E1DR_4W3_1:E1DRA]
~z~This country is so fucked up. Republicans. Democrats. It's crazy.
[E1DR_4W3_3:E1DRA]
~z~That's why we got The Lost MC. It's the one thing that makes sense.
[E1DR_4W3_5:E1DRA]
~z~It used to, maybe.
[E1DR_4W3_7:E1DRA]
~z~It still means something, Johnny. It does.
[E1DR_4W3_9:E1DRA]
~z~I hope so.
[E1DR_4W3_11:E1DRA]
~z~What're we talking about?

[E1DR_4W4_1:E1DRA]
~z~I need a woman. Arghh.
[E1DR_4W4_3:E1DRA]
~z~How 'bout Johnny here? He's pretty enough.
[E1DR_4W4_5:E1DRA]
~z~You don't get it. I got needs. 
[E1DR_4W4_6:E1DRA]
~z~Yeah, you needs to sober up.
[E1DR_4W4_8:E1DRA]
~z~I'm sober enough, man.
[E1DR_4W4_10:E1DRA]
~z~It's a pity none of the women in this city are drunk enough.
[E1DR_4W4_12:E1DRA]
~z~Cold, man.
[E1DR_4W4_14:E1DRA]
~z~~s~

[E1DR_4W5_1:E1DRA]
~z~Dudes? Dudes?
[E1DR_4W5_3:E1DRA]
~z~Yup?
[E1DR_4W5_5:E1DRA]
~z~Yo.
[E1DR_4W5_6:E1DRA]
~z~Dudes. You're the fucking greatest. You're - you're my brothers.
[E1DR_4W5_8:E1DRA]
~z~And you're my brother, man.
[E1DR_4W5_10:E1DRA]
~z~Johnny Klebitz!

[E1DR_JTC1_1:E1DRA]
~z~I'm hella drunk.
[E1DR_JTC1_3:E1DRA]
~z~Shit, we gotta look after him
[E1DR_JTC1_5:E1DRA]
~z~Same old story - getting this cocksucker outta trouble.
[E1DR_JTC1_6:E1DRA]
~z~Good thing I'm sober. Sober as a fuckin' judge.
[E1DR_JTC1_8:E1DRA]
~z~Shit, I'm drunk as the judge who threw that last case of yours outta court.
[E1DR_JTC1_10:E1DRA]
~z~Wasn't drunkenness that got Terrance off. It was good old fashioned witness intimidation. 
[E1DR_JTC1_12:E1DRA]
~z~Yee haw!
[E1DR_JTC1_14:E1DRA]
~z~~s~
[E1DR_JTC1_15:E1DRA]
~z~Ha, ha will drink to that.

[E1DR_JTC2_1:E1DRA]
~z~These colors don't run, man.
[E1DR_JTC2_3:E1DRA]
~z~Lost forever. Forever Lost.
[E1DR_JTC2_5:E1DRA]
~z~We got brothers, man. Fuck the numbers, we got brothers.
[E1DR_JTC2_7:E1DRA]
~z~Lost MC for motherfucking life!
[E1DR_JTC2_9:E1DRA]
~z~Ain't you two some walkin' fucking clichés. 
[E1DR_JTC2_10:E1DRA]
~z~How bout we drop the sentiment and find us some pussy?
[E1DR_JTC2_12:E1DRA]
~z~That is if I don't pass out first.

[E1DR_JC1_1:E1DRA]
~z~Johnny, man, I'd follow you. I'd follow you anywhere.
[E1DR_JC1_2:E1DRA]
~z~But you're hoping I'll lead you to some hookers or something, right?
[E1DR_JC1_4:E1DRA]
~z~I wish you would, but I know you too much of a sensitive motherfucker to do that.
[E1DR_JC1_5:E1DRA]
~z~Sensitive like a kick in the balls.
[E1DR_JC1_7:E1DRA]
~z~Look, all I'm hoping is if I follow you I ain't gonna end up naked under the turnpike.
[E1DR_JC1_9:E1DRA]
~z~Ha ha ha. I can't guarantee that.

[E1DR_JC2_1:E1DRA]
~z~Clay, man, Clay. You ever thought about being, like, chapter president?
[E1DR_JC2_3:E1DRA]
~z~I ain't gonna challenge your position, man.
[E1DR_JC2_4:E1DRA]
~z~I didn't mean it like that. I think you'd do good.
[E1DR_JC2_6:E1DRA]
~z~Yo. I ain't built to make the orders, just to follow them. Done that my whole career.
[E1DR_JC2_8:E1DRA]
~z~Oh yeah?
[E1DR_JC2_9:E1DRA]
~z~Making orders at Burger Shot? Now, them's some orders I can handle.

[E1DR_JC3_1:E1DRA]
~z~Johnny, man? What's your pussy situation?
[E1DR_JC3_3:E1DRA]
~z~Pussy situation? Don't think I got one.
[E1DR_JC3_5:E1DRA]
~z~Yeah? Shit. I could throw you a lady.
[E1DR_JC3_6:E1DRA]
~z~They'd be disappointed at first. But, like, eventually... they'd get used to you.
[E1DR_JC3_8:E1DRA]
~z~Real sweet of you, brother, but I'm cool. I kinda swore off women for a while.
[E1DR_JC3_10:E1DRA]
~z~What, man?
[E1DR_JC3_12:E1DRA]
~z~You were being serious?
[E1DR_JC3_14:E1DRA]
~z~~s~

[E1DR_JC4_1:E1DRA]
~z~Billy, man, Billy, I don't get it.
[E1DR_JC4_3:E1DRA]
~z~Billy ain't here, Clay. 
[E1DR_JC4_5:E1DRA]
~z~Shit, I know that. We was drinking not smoking peyote, you dumb motherfucker.
[E1DR_JC4_6:E1DRA]
~z~What about Billy then?
[E1DR_JC4_8:E1DRA]
~z~Don't get it, is all. What you guys' thing about him is?
[E1DR_JC4_10:E1DRA]
~z~Yeah, well... Who fucking cares. Billy ain't here.

[E1DR_JC5_1:E1DRA]
~z~This club, man. It's fucking cool.
[E1DR_JC5_3:E1DRA]
~z~Used to be a lot cooler.
[E1DR_JC5_5:E1DRA]
~z~That's cool. It brings us together.
[E1DR_JC5_6:E1DRA]
~z~You - a confused as shit, sexually repressed, overly sensitive, Jewish maniac.
[E1DR_JC5_8:E1DRA]
~z~Got me in one.
[E1DR_JC5_10:E1DRA]
~z~And me - a man of the world, a gifted lover, a man with discipline and charm. 
[E1DR_JC5_11:E1DRA]
~z~A man with sexually transmitted diseases that ain't been heard of in the West. 
[E1DR_JC5_13:E1DRA]
~z~Ha, ha! The brotherhood brings us together.
[E1DR_JC5_15:E1DRA]
~z~It fucking does, man. Brothers for life.

[E1DR_JT1_1:E1DRA]
~z~Man, I'm so drunk. I think someone's watching us.
[E1DR_JT1_3:E1DRA]
~z~No one's watching us, brother.
[E1DR_JT1_5:E1DRA]
~z~I bet it's my ex wife.
[E1DR_JT1_7:E1DRA]
~z~I bet it ain't.
[E1DR_JT1_9:E1DRA]
~z~I still love her man. I still love her!
[E1DR_JT1_11:E1DRA]
~z~Good for you.

[E1DR_JT2_1:E1DRA]
~z~Sometimes, Johnny, sometimes I wonder.
[E1DR_JT2_3:E1DRA]
~z~Wonder what brother?
[E1DR_JT2_5:E1DRA]
~z~Maybe I should have done something - I don't know, different with my life. Gone clean.
[E1DR_JT2_7:E1DRA]
~z~I don't know about that but you could have at least tried washing.
[E1DR_JT2_9:E1DRA]
~z~Ha fucking ha. I open my heart up to you brother and you crack a joke. Fuck you man.
[E1DR_JT2_11:E1DRA]
~z~I'm sorry brother, I'm just a little drunk.

[E1DR_JT3_1:E1DRA]
~z~Man I am d-runk
[E1DR_JT3_3:E1DRA]
~z~I'm sober as can be, brother.
[E1DR_JT3_5:E1DRA]
~z~Probably drinking Logger Lite. 
[E1DR_JT3_7:E1DRA]
~z~You know, sometimes I think there must be more to life than boozing, and women and fucking war.
[E1DR_JT3_9:E1DRA]
~z~Good for you, man
[E1DR_JT3_11:E1DRA]
~z~And then I try to think what and the only thing I can come up with is bullshit.
[E1DR_JT3_13:E1DRA]
~z~That's real deep, brother.
[E1DR_JT3_15:E1DRA]
~z~I know. 

[E1DR_JT4_1:E1DRA]
~z~Man I am drunk as fuck
[E1DR_JT4_3:E1DRA]
~z~Good for you brother. Good for you
[E1DR_JT4_5:E1DRA]
~z~It is good for me. When I'm drunk, women find me irresistible.
[E1DR_JT4_7:E1DRA]
~z~I can only imagine.
[E1DR_JT4_9:E1DRA]
~z~It's the truth man.
[E1DR_JT4_11:E1DRA]
~z~I'm sure.
[E1DR_JT4_13:E1DRA]
~z~Fuck you.

[E1DR_JT5_1:E1DRA]
~z~I'm wasted, man
[E1DR_JT5_3:E1DRA]
~z~Me too, Terry
[E1DR_JT5_5:E1DRA]
~z~You know, I used to really love this fucking country.
[E1DR_JT5_7:E1DRA]
~z~You did?
[E1DR_JT5_9:E1DRA]
~z~Sure - what the happened?
[E1DR_JT5_11:E1DRA]
~z~You grew up?
[E1DR_JT5_13:E1DRA]
~z~Sure did... I think I might puke...

[E1DR_JJ_1:E1DRA]
~z~Johnny, man.
[E1DR_JJ_3:E1DRA]
~z~I'm here, man.
[E1DR_JJ_5:E1DRA]
~z~Look after 'em, man
[E1DR_JJ_7:E1DRA]
~z~What do you mean?
[E1DR_JJ_8:E1DRA]
~z~Just look after 'em. You know, if something...
[E1DR_JJ_9:E1DRA]
~z~Shut the fuck up. I told you not to drink that whisky.
[E1DR_JJ_11:E1DRA]
~z~Just say you will.
[E1DR_JJ_13:E1DRA]
~z~I will. Now shut up.


{Battle buddy}

[E1BB_JT1_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Good to have you with me, Terrence.
[E1BB_JT1_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Good to have something to do, man.
[E1BB_JT1_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Let's fuck shit up.

[E1BB_JT2_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Let's hit 'em hard, Johnny.
[E1BB_JT2_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Is there any other way?
[E1BB_JT2_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Maybe, man. Rumor is you've gone soft.
[E1BB_JT2_7:E1BBAU]
~z~I listened to rumors, I'd think you and Clay were a same sex couple.

[E1BB_JT3_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Hey, Prez. You ready for this?
[E1BB_JT3_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Why you calling me Prez?
[E1BB_JT3_5:E1BBAU]
~z~That's your fucking title, ain't it?
[E1BB_JT3_7:E1BBAU]
~z~I don't believe in that shit, man. Us brothers are equal. Let's kick some ass.

[E1BB_JT4_1:E1BBAU]
~z~President Klebitz, leading the fucking charge.
[E1BB_JT4_3:E1BBAU]
~z~If I'm President, do I get to lay down a new law?
[E1BB_JT4_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Go for it, Prez.
[E1BB_JT4_7:E1BBAU]
~z~Law is you've got to shut the fuck up, Terry.
[E1BB_JT4_9:E1BBAU]
~z~Ha ha. Screw you, man.

[E1BB_JT5_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Where you at, boys.
[E1BB_JT5_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Right behind you, man.
[E1BB_JT5_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Good to know, my brother.

[E1BB_JT6_1:E1BBAU]
~z~A motley fucking crew we are.
[E1BB_JT6_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Lost MC always has been, man. The stragglers and the strays.
[E1BB_JT6_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Outlaws, dude. Fucking lunatics. 
[E1BB_JT6_7:E1BBAU]
~z~And you're in charge of the asylum. Ha, ha, ha. No wonder I have trouble sleeping at night.
[E1BB_JT6_9:E1BBAU]
~z~Ha ha ha. 

[E1BB_JC1_1:E1BBAU]
~z~You and me Clayton. 
[E1BB_JC1_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Just like old times - fucking up scumbags!
[E1BB_JC1_4:E1BBAU]
~z~You know it.

[E1BB_JC2_1:E1BBAU]
~z~You ready for this, brother?
[E1BB_JC2_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Well, I had a manicure booked.
[E1BB_JC2_4:E1BBAU]
~z~Shame to miss it!
[E1BB_JC2_6:E1BBAU]
~z~Yeah, but on mature reflection, I'd rather go bust some fucking heads!

[E1BB_JC3_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Fuck these motherfuckers, man. Fuck them.
[E1BB_JC3_3:E1BBAU]
~z~You said it, brother. 
[E1BB_JC3_4:E1BBAU]
~z~They think we're bitches? Fuck them. They are going to pay.
[E1BB_JC3_6:E1BBAU]
~z~My brother! 

[E1BB_JC4_1:E1BBAU]
~z~You ready to party, brother?
[E1BB_JC4_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Always. 
[E1BB_JC4_4:E1BBAU]
~z~I knew it.
[E1BB_JC4_6:E1BBAU]
~z~This is it for me. I live for the action, man.
[E1BB_JC4_8:E1BBAU]
~z~That's my brother! 

[E1BB_JC5_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Man, this shit is going to be fun.
[E1BB_JC5_3:E1BBAU]
~z~For you, maybe.
[E1BB_JC5_4:E1BBAU]
~z~Abso-fucking-lutely. Nothing beats rolling on fools, man
[E1BB_JC5_6:E1BBAU]
~z~I guess not. 

[E1BB_JC6_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Johnny K! Good to be rolling with you, man.
[E1BB_JC6_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Thanks, brother.
[E1BB_JC6_5:E1BBAU]
~z~It's guys like you and Terry - fighting alongside you is what makes this shit fun.
[E1BB_JC6_7:E1BBAU]
~z~Sure is.
[E1BB_JC6_8:E1BBAU]
~z~That and kicking the shit out of people. 

[E1BB_CT1_1:E1BBAU]
~z~You ready for this, T?
[E1BB_CT1_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Always, man. Always. 
[E1BB_CT1_5:E1BBAU]
~z~I hope so. Just as long as you don't start crying again.
[E1BB_CT1_7:E1BBAU]
~z~Funny guy. 

[E1BB_CT2_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Why are we always helping out Johnny man?
[E1BB_CT2_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Because we hearted.
[E1BB_CT2_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Maybe in your case.
[E1BB_CT2_7:E1BBAU]
~z~Okay - what about you?
[E1BB_CT2_9:E1BBAU]
~z~For me, I just like war. 
[E1BB_CT2_11:E1BBAU]
~z~Spoken like a true American. 

[E1BB_CT3_1:E1BBAU]
~z~You ready for war, brother?
[E1BB_CT3_3:E1BBAU]
~z~You know me.
[E1BB_CT3_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Sure I do, that's why I'm asking.
[E1BB_CT3_7:E1BBAU]
~z~You wanna repeat that, bitch?
[E1BB_CT3_9:E1BBAU]
~z~Any time, just say the word. 
[E1BB_CT3_10:E1BBAU]
~z~Right now, bitch.
[E1BB_CT3_12:E1BBAU]
~z~Chill out, brother. Jesus - I was only fucking with you. 
[E1BB_CT3_14:E1BBAU]
~z~Do I look like I need you fucking with me?

[E1BB_CT4_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Yo, Clay.
[E1BB_CT4_3:E1BBAU]
~z~What T?
[E1BB_CT4_5:E1BBAU]
~z~How come you ain't giving me a hard time?
[E1BB_CT4_7:E1BBAU]
~z~Because I get bored of picking on weaklings. 
[E1BB_CT4_9:E1BBAU]
~z~Funny
[E1BB_CT4_10:E1BBAU]
~z~And you get so emotional before we fight. I don't like to disrupt your rage. 
[E1BB_CT4_12:E1BBAU]
~z~Fuck you.

[E1BB_JTC1_1:E1BBAU]
~z~Let's do this, boys. 
[E1BB_JTC1_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Let's fucking do it.
[E1BB_JTC1_4:E1BBAU]
~z~What exactly are we doin'?
[E1BB_JTC1_6:E1BBAU]
~z~Don't ask stupid questions, man.

[E1BB_JTC2_1:E1BBAU]
~z~The Lost MC riding together. Feels like the old days!
[E1BB_JTC2_3:E1BBAU]
~z~Yeah, before the federal government started takin' our civil rights away.
[E1BB_JTC2_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Before Terry started to think the feds were monitoring his brain waves?
[E1BB_JTC2_7:E1BBAU]
~z~Before brothers started believing their own bullshit. Come on!

[E1BB_JTC3_1:E1BBAU]
~z~A brother might stab you in the back. 
[E1BB_JTC3_3:E1BBAU]
~z~A woman certainly will. But a bike will never let you down.
[E1BB_JTC3_5:E1BBAU]
~z~Amen to that.
[E1BB_JTC3_6:E1BBAU]
~z~Unless you're Terrence here and you're eating asphalt after every corner.
[E1BB_JTC3_8:E1BBAU]
~z~You go O.T.B. more than me, man.
[E1BB_JTC3_10:E1BBAU]
~z~That's you letting the bikes down, brothers. Not the other way round. Let's get this done!

[E1BB_JTC4_1:E1BBAU]
~z~If you had to give one of 'em up, brothers, which would it be - bikes or women?
[E1BB_JTC4_3:E1BBAU]
~z~I wanna say women, but I know I'm weak for 'em.
[E1BB_JTC4_5:E1BBAU]
~z~I couldn't give up my bike, man. The outlaw lifestyle. This shit.
[E1BB_JTC4_7:E1BBAU]
~z~You, Clay?
[E1BB_JTC4_9:E1BBAU]
~z~I'm a multi-tasker, man. I can handle bikes and bitches. It's you chumps I was worrying about.
[E1BB_JTC4_11:E1BBAU]
~z~I wanna see you prove it! Come on!


{E1BE}

[E1BE_1_01:E1BEA]
~z~What were you saying, Clay?
[E1BE_1_02:E1BEA]
~z~So Clay, where were we?
[E1BE_1_03:E1BEA]
~z~All good, brother?

~z~Man, Terry, that shit is fucked up
[E1BE_4_03:E1BEA]
~z~Terry, man. Shit
[E1BE_4_04:E1BEA]
~z~Oh, man. Terry!
[E1BE_4_05:E1BEA]
~z~I always worried about Terry, man.
[E1BE_4_06:E1BEA]
~z~Terry, man. Poor fucker's fallen.

[E1BE_5_01:E1BEA]
~z~Fuck, Clay took one.
[E1BE_5_02:E1BEA]
~z~Shit, Clay's down.
[E1BE_5_03:E1BEA]
~z~Clay, brother, I'm sorry.
[E1BE_5_04:E1BEA]
~z~Clay. Shit. This is one fucked up life we're livin'.
[E1BE_5_05:E1BEA]
~z~Clay, dude, shit.
[E1BE_5_06:E1BEA]
~z~Ahh, Clay, shit. We'll get these fuckers for you.

[E1BE_6_01:E1BEA]
~z~Hey man, this is us.
[E1BE_6_02:E1BEA]
~z~Let's get out of here, Terry. Later on, man.

[E1BE_8_02:E1BEA]
~z~Johnny, I think it's time me and Clay got outta here. Later.
[E1BE_8_03:E1BEA]
~z~So long, Johnny. Time for me and Clay made tracks.

[E1BE_9_01:E1BEA]
~z~I'm outta here, man. So long.
[E1BE_9_02:E1BEA]
~z~I've got to bid you adieu, my brother. Later on.
[E1BE_9_03:E1BEA]
~z~I'm rolling outta here, Johnny. Call me.

[E1BE_10_01:E1BEA]
~z~Thank you for your assistance. I can take it from here.
[E1BE_10_02:E1BEA]

~z~I think I got all the help I needed. See you.
[E1BE_10_05:E1BEA]
~z~I think this is a job for one man, now. Later.
[E1BE_10_06:E1BEA]
~z~You're starting to cramp my style. Thanks for the help.

[E1BE_11_01:E1BEA]

~z~We're holding down here, man.

[E1BE_15_04:E1BEA]
~z~Ummm, remind me why I got outta bed, will you?
[E1BE_15_05:E1BEA]
~z~So... um.... What the fuck?

[E1BE_16_01:E1BEA]
~z~If our mommas could see us now.
[E1BE_16_02:E1BEA]
~z~How about this?
[E1BE_16_03:E1BEA]
~z~Just some brothers having a good time.
[E1BE_16_04:E1BEA]
~z~I appreciate this assistance. 
[E1BE_16_05:E1BEA]
~z~OK, enough of this tire kicking...

[E1BE_17_01:E1BEA]
~z~Well... Well... Well.
[E1BE_17_02:E1BEA]
~z~This sure beats my other plans.
[E1BE_17_03:E1BEA]
~z~These clothes are chafing me.
[E1BE_17_04:E1BEA]
~z~What's goin' on?
[E1BE_17_05:E1BEA]
~z~Okay then... where we at?

[E1BE_18_01:E1BEA]
~z~Fucking doctors ain't gonna stop me smoking...
[E1BE_18_02:E1BEA]
~z~Shit, I love a smoke.
[E1BE_18_03:E1BEA]
~z~My ex fucking hated it when I smoked.
[E1BE_18_04:E1BEA]
~z~Remember the days when you didn't have to suck down half the periodic table with your tobacco?
[E1BE_18_05:E1BEA]
~z~Nothing says America like guns and cigarettes.
[E1BE_18_06:E1BEA]
~z~The right to smoke should be written in the Consti-fucking-tution, man. Screw the liberals.

[E1BE_19_01:E1BEA]

~z~You gotta come with me. I got to show you something. 
[RPI1_CUT_25:RPi1AUD]
~z~Billy... he controlled me. I'm so ashamed.
[RPI1_CUT_26:RPi1AUD]
~z~I gotta come clean. Come with me, please... 
[RPI1_CUT_27:RPi1AUD]
~z~Fuck you Brian.
[RPI1_CUT_28:RPi1AUD]
~z~I can help you save the club, man. Seriously. 
[RPI1_CUT_29:RPi1AUD]
~z~Then I'll leave town. 
[RPI1_CUT_30:RPi1AUD]
~z~Okay... but if you're fucking with me,
[RPI1_CUT_31:RPi1AUD]
~z~I'm gonna put a bullet right through your fucking skull Brian. 

[RPi1_FAIL_1:RPi1AUD]
~z~This don't feel right to me, man. Now get the fuck out of here.

[RPi1_AOD_1:RPi1AUD]
~z~Johnny's a fucking Judas.
[RPi1_AOD_3:RPi1AUD]
~z~You're a dick.

[RPi1_MOCK_1:RPi1AUD]
~z~Heh heh heh. You didn't expect this one, did you?
[RPi1_MOCK_3:RPi1AUD]
~z~Fuck you, Klebitz-o-witz.

[RPi1_MUT_01:RPi1AUD]
~z~You best be legit, Brian.
[RPi1_MUT_02:RPi1AUD]
~z~I hope I don't regret not killing you, Brian.
[RPi1_MUT_03:RPi1AUD]
~z~This feels weird, dude.
[RPi1_MUT_04:RPi1AUD]
~z~Where you taking me now, boy?
[RPi1_MUT_05:RPi1AUD]
~z~You're still a snivelling little shit, man.
[RPi1_MUT_06:RPi1AUD]
~z~I don't know how Billy put up with you, man.

[RPi1_ATTB_01:RPi1AUD]
~z~You ain't getting away from here, Brian.
[RPi1_ATTB_02:RPi1AUD]
~z~You're dead, Brian.
[RPi1_ATTB_03:RPi1AUD]
~z~You little fucking shit. Fuck you, Brian.
[RPi1_ATTB_04:RPi1AUD]
~z~That's the last insult, motherfucker.
[RPi1_ATTB_05:RPi1AUD]
~z~I hope you die scared, Brian. You little bitch.
[RPi1_ATTB_06:RPi1AUD]
~z~Brian, you mother fucking little piece of shit. Die! 


{MALC1}

[MALC1_FOLLO_01:MALC1AU]
~z~Follow me, man. 
[MALC1_FOLLO_02:MALC1AU]
~z~Alright man, follow me.
[MALC1_FOLLO_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Stay behind me, Johnny.

[MALC1_B1V1_1:MALC1AU]
~z~How about that? You and me just bumpin' into one another like that.
[MALC1_B1V1_3:MALC1AU]
~z~Yeah, man. That's Liberty City for you.
[MALC1_B1V1_5:MALC1AU]
~z~For a big fat city, it's a real small place.

[MALC1_B1V2_1:MALC1AU]
~z~What we doin' on this run anyway?
[MALC1_B1V2_3:MALC1AU]
~z~We gotta go see somebody about something, aight?
[MALC1_B1V2_5:MALC1AU]
~z~Thanks for enlightening me.

[MALC1_STOP_01:MALC1AU]
~z~Hold up, hold up. This is it.
[MALC1_STOP_02:MALC1AU]
~z~Yo, yo, yo, pull up here.
[MALC1_STOP_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Can we just stop for a minute?

[MALC1_PCALL_01:MALC1AU]
~z~DeSean? Shit man, I thought you was with Big D. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah we on our way.
[MALC1_PCALL_02:MALC1AU]
~z~Yo, B. You didn't have to get yourself shot, now? Shit, we coming. We coming.
[MALC1_PCALL_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Yo, what? Them rat bastards shot you? Shit yo, don't worry. Me and Johnny's on the way.

[MALC1_FOLL2_01:MALC1AU]
~z~DeSean's been shot. We gotta help him. Can you follow me? 
[MALC1_FOLL2_02:MALC1AU]
~z~Motherfuckers shot DeSean. You down to help me or what?
[MALC1_FOLL2_03:MALC1AU]
~z~DeSean's in trouble. Can you help a brother out?

[MALC1_B2V1_1:MALC1AU]
~z~I sure hope D's learnt how to hold his tongue. Last time he got hit, he couldn't shut the fuck up.
[MALC1_B2V1_3:MALC1AU]
~z~Shit, Malc. You're real sympathetic to your friend.
[MALC1_B2V1_5:MALC1AU]
~z~The game is the fucking game, Johnny. You know that.

[MALC1_B2V2_1:MALC1AU]
~z~You think DeSean's okay, man?
[MALC1_B2V2_3:MALC1AU]
~z~DeSean's aight, probably only got hit with a nine. The fool's on the phone, right?

[MALC1_FIND_1:MALC1AU]
~z~Shit, D. You don't look so bad. 
[MALC1_FIND_3:MALC1AU]
~z~Yeah, they just grazed me. It's the principle, you know? 
[MALC1_FIND_5:MALC1AU]
~z~They only meant to be using baseball bats in the race. I wasn't expecting no lead slinging.
[MALC1_FIND_7:MALC1AU]
~z~How about we hit 'em right back, man?
[MALC1_FIND_9:MALC1AU]
~z~Sounds good, Johnny.

[MALC1_B3V1_1:MALC1AU]
~z~I guess we got a change of plans. 
[MALC1_B3V1_3:MALC1AU]
~z~Plans tend to change when someone gets shot.

[MALC1_3V2_1:MALC1AU]
~z~You ever been shot at in one of those races, Malcolm?
[MALC1_3V2_3:MALC1AU]
~z~Man, shit. I'm too far in front of these bitches to get shot.

[MALC1_MALC_01:MALC1AU]
~z~Oh, y'all cheaters, huh?
[MALC1_MALC_02:MALC1AU]
~z~We the Uptown Riders, son.
[MALC1_MALC_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Don't never come uptown again.
[MALC1_MALC_04:MALC1AU]
~z~You lucky you didn't kill my boy, DeSean.
[MALC1_MALC_05:MALC1AU]
~z~Come on now, DeSean shootin' motherfuckers.
[MALC1_MALC_06:MALC1AU]
~z~You shoulda just raced all peaceable like motherfucker.

[MALC1_FIGHT1_1:MALC1AU]
~z~Good looking on the help out Johnny.
[MALC1_FIGHT1_3:MALC1AU]
~z~No problemo, Malcolm. 

[MALC1_FIGHT2_1:MALC1AU]
~z~Malc, Malc. You think Johnny's trying to become a Uptown Riders prospect or something?
[MALC1_FIGHT2_2:MALC1AU]
~z~I sure hope so. Can't wait to haze the shit out of the fucker.

[MALC1_DIES_1:MALC1AU]
~z~We were meant to be hitting back for DeSean. Not getting him killed, man.
[MALC1_DIES_3:MALC1AU]
~z~I know, man. I know. At least he went down with his head held high. See you round.

[MALC1_DONE_1:MALC1AU]
~z~Yeah, we just hit one out the park for fair play.
[MALC1_DONE_3:MALC1AU]
~z~For sure, for sure.
[MALC1_DONE_5:MALC1AU]
~z~Well, gentlemen. I might excuse myself. See you soon, yeah?

[MALC1_DFOLL_01:MALC1AU]
~z~I'm gonna lead you to 'em.
[MALC1_DFOLL_02:MALC1AU]
~z~I'll take you to 'em, boys.
[MALC1_DFOLL_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Yo, let's go find 'em then.

[MALC1_B4V1_1:MALC1AU]
~z~So, I was wondering, what did they, like, ahh, shoot you with?
[MALC1_B4V1_3:MALC1AU]
~z~It was more like they shot at me. Them shotguns can't do nothing at a range. 
[MALC1_B4V1_5:MALC1AU]
~z~Only got a few pellets in my arm.
[MALC1_B4V1_7:MALC1AU]
~z~Yeah, man. You really got to get up close and personal to make the most of them things. 

[MALC1_B4V2_1:MALC1AU]
~z~You ever turn a gun on someone in a race man?
[MALC1_B4V2_3:MALC1AU]
~z~I look like a need help? You don't need to shoot a guy who got a bat two feet up his ass.
[MALC1_B4V2_5:MALC1AU]
~z~No. No, I guess you don't. Nice image, by the way. You just put me off corn dogs for life. 

[MALC1_THEM_01:MALC1AU]
~z~There they are. Yo, let's school these punks.
[MALC1_THEM_02:MALC1AU]
~z~That's them cheatin' punks. Yo, we gonna teach 'em something.
[MALC1_THEM_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Shit, if it ain't the cheating motherfuckers right there.

[MALC1_DFIGHT_01:MALC1AU]
~z~You thought you could fuck with me like that?
[MALC1_DFIGHT_02:MALC1AU]
~z~There rules in this game, son.
[MALC1_DFIGHT_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Oh, you like spitting lead, huh?
[MALC1_DFIGHT_04:MALC1AU]
~z~This about to be brought.
[MALC1_DFIGHT_05:MALC1AU]
~z~Come on then. Come on.
[MALC1_DFIGHT_06:MALC1AU]
~z~It's on, you double crossin' punk ass fucks

[MALC1_BF2_1:MALC1AU]
~z~How you holding up DeSean. You in pain?
[MALC1_BF2_3:MALC1AU]
~z~Yo, I'm alright. Motherfuckers should'a killed me.

[MALC1_BF4_1:MALC1AU]
~z~Johnny, man. How you coping?
[MALC1_BF4_3:MALC1AU]
~z~Me? I'm doing fine. I ain't the one whinging about a little flesh wound.
[MALC1_BF4_5:MALC1AU]
~z~Shit.

[MALC1_MDIES_1:MALC1AU]
~z~Man, Malcolm got got. I knew those boys were punks.
[MALC1_MDIES_3:MALC1AU]
~z~We'll find those assholes. Don't worry. I'll catch you later, man.

[MALC1_COOL_01:MALC1AU]
~z~Let's do it.
[MALC1_COOL_02:MALC1AU]
~z~I'm down. Let's go.
[MALC1_COOL_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Right behind you, Malc.

[MALC1_CUT_1:MALC1AU]
~z~Hey yo, Johnny, give me a hand, man? 
[MALC1_CUT_2:MALC1AU]
~z~Why man, what's up? That hot import givin' you trouble? 
[MALC1_CUT_3:MALC1AU]
~z~Come on man, I'm not in the mood for fuckin' jokes.
[MALC1_CUT_4:MALC1AU]
~z~Hey, take it easy. I don't mean nothing by it.
[MALC1_CUT_5:MALC1AU]
~z~My bust, man. I'm kind of stressed.
[MALC1_CUT_6:MALC1AU]
~z~My boy DeSean ain't showed and we're suppose to roll together.
[MALC1_CUT_7:MALC1AU]
~z~I think he's up in his girl's crib or something.
[MALC1_CUT_8:MALC1AU]
~z~Well, I can see how that could be annoying. 
[MALC1_CUT_9:MALC1AU]
~z~I forgive you for your earlier aggressive manner.
[MALC1_CUT_10:MALC1AU]
~z~I really fuckin' appreciate that, but what the fuck am I going to do now?
[MALC1_CUT_11:MALC1AU]
~z~I can't do this for self.
[MALC1_CUT_12:MALC1AU]
~z~Okay I got it, I'll help a friend in need. 
[MALC1_CUT_13:MALC1AU]
~z~Question is, you gonna be able to get that thing started? 
[MALC1_CUT_14:MALC1AU]
~z~Watch me.
[MALC1_CUT_15:MALC1AU]
~z~There she is. That's my girl. 
[MALC1_CUT_16:MALC1AU]
~z~C'mon man, she don't like to wait.

[MALC1_ATTCK_01:MALC1AU]
~z~I don't like cheaters.
[MALC1_ATTCK_02:MALC1AU]
~z~You fucked with a friend of mine.
[MALC1_ATTCK_03:MALC1AU]
~z~Recognise this guy, you motherfuckers?
[MALC1_ATTCK_04:MALC1AU]
~z~Despicable.
[MALC1_ATTCK_05:MALC1AU]
~z~Fucking slimeballs.
[MALC1_ATTCK_06:MALC1AU]
~z~You don't wanna know what I'd do if you'd killed my friend.
[MALC1_ATTCK_07:MALC1AU]
~z~Cheating bastards.
[MALC1_ATTCK_08:MALC1AU]
~z~Weak motherfuckers.


{MALC2}

[MALC2_FOLO_01:MALC2AU]
~z~Alright. Stick with me, boy.
[MALC2_FOLO_02:MALC2AU]
~z~See if you can keep up with an Uptown Rider.
[MALC2_FOLO_03:MALC2AU]
~z~Keep up with me now, Johnny.

[MALC2_B1V1_1:MALC2AU]
~z~Hey yo, this is one of them races like DeSean got himself shot in before.
[MALC2_B1V1_3:MALC2AU]
~z~Here's hopin' no one pulls a piece on us this time round.
[MALC2_B1V1_5:MALC2AU]
~z~Yo, you just keep yours in your pants as well. I know how itchy that finger gets.

[MALC2_B1V2_1:MALC2AU]
~z~So, Malc, I got a feeling you're not gonna win this race.
[MALC2_B1V2_3:MALC2AU]
~z~What? Shit I'm all over this.
[MALC2_B1V2_5:MALC2AU]
~z~Second's the most you can hope for, man. 
[MALC2_B1V2_7:MALC2AU]
~z~I'm taking this American machine right here across the finish first.

[MALC2_ARR_01:MALC2AU]
~z~We're at the starting block, boy. Come on.
[MALC2_ARR_02:MALC2AU]
~z~This is where it starts. Let's go.
[MALC2_ARR_03:MALC2AU]
~z~And here we be. You ready?

[MALC2_BAT_01:MALC2AU]
~z~Here's a bat, Johnny. Knock em outta the park, man.
[MALC2_BAT_02:MALC2AU]
~z~Take this shit, yo. Smash a mother fucker good if you have to.
[MALC2_BAT_03:MALC2AU]
~z~Pretend like you're in the Liberty City Swingers, man. Knock 'em the fuck out.

[MALC2_SHOOT_01:MALC2AU]
~z~Remember not to shoot nobody. But you ain't gotta be all friendly up in this bitch.
[MALC2_SHOOT_02:MALC2AU]
~z~Remember guns ain't appropriate here, Johnny. Keep that shit to yourself.
[MALC2_SHOOT_03:MALC2AU]
~z~Hey yo, Johnny, remember, don't shoot anyone till the race is over, aight?

[MALC2_FAIL_1:MALC2AU]
~z~Man, I told you not to get your gun out.
[MALC2_FAIL_3:MALC2AU]
~z~Sorry, dude, I just couldn't help myself 
[MALC2_FAIL_5:MALC2AU]
~z~Haven't liked bats since I got kicked outta little league. Later on.

[MALC2_FAIL2_1:MALC2AU]
~z~Shit, looks like you and me got played, Johnny.
[MALC2_FAIL2_3:MALC2AU]
~z~You got a serious competitive streak in you, Malcolm. 
[MALC2_FAIL2_5:MALC2AU]
~z~Me, I'm at peace with the result. I'll see you soon.

[MALC2_FAIL3_1:MALC2AU]
~z~Well, well, well, if my little baby here didn't burn your antiquated ass Johnny boy. 
[MALC2_FAIL3_3:MALC2AU]
~z~You been fiddlin' with that rice burner, Malcolm?
[MALC2_FAIL3_5:MALC2AU]
~z~I'd like to see you beat me on a real bike. Later on.

[MALC2_PASS_1:MALC2AU]
~z~Aight, aight. Everybody get lucky once and a while.
[MALC2_PASS_3:MALC2AU]
~z~I was lucky to be born in the U-S of A, dude. 
[MALC2_PASS_5:MALC2AU]
~z~I was lucky to be born after the invention of penicillin and the internal combustion engine. 
[MALC2_PASS_6:MALC2AU]
~z~But that there race was pure skill. So long, buddy.
[MALC2_PASS_8:MALC2AU]
~z~Peace out.

[MALC2_CUT_1:MALC2AU]
~z~What up, Johnny boy?
[MALC2_CUT_2:MALC2AU]
~z~Hey Malc.
[MALC2_CUT_3:MALC2AU]
~z~It's all good. How'd them problems you were having work out?
[MALC2_CUT_4:MALC2AU]
~z~About the same as your bike. 
[MALC2_CUT_5:MALC2AU]
~z~What? You need to be easy, funny man. 
[MALC2_CUT_6:MALC2AU]
~z~Lighten up.
[MALC2_CUT_7:MALC2AU]
~z~Ah man shit, you think you got monster nuts. 
[MALC2_CUT_8:MALC2AU]
~z~You know what? Pull 'em out, roll with me right now. 
[MALC2_CUT_9:MALC2AU]
~z~-Oh yeah.~n~-No doubt. 
[MALC2_CUT_10:MALC2AU]
~z~There's some serious cats on the other side of town looking for a race. 
[MALC2_CUT_11:MALC2AU]
~z~And this ain't no pussy ass polite race either. 
[MALC2_CUT_12:MALC2AU]
~z~We gonna be scrappin' all the way. 
[MALC2_CUT_13:MALC2AU]
~z~So what's up? You in?
[MALC2_CUT_14:MALC2AU]
~z~Yeah, I'm in. 
[MALC2_CUT_15:MALC2AU]

[E1MF_CALL1_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Ash?
[E1MF_CALL1_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Johnny boy? John. I need some help.
[E1MF_CALL1_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I ain't got a hand-out for ya. Sorry.
[E1MF_CALL1_7:E1MFAU]
~z~A hand-out ain't gonna fix it, Johnny boy. I'm into something bad. 
[E1MF_CALL1_9:E1MFAU]
~z~I need a knight in shining armor to take me away from this mess. They're gonna kill me... or worse.
[E1MF_CALL1_11:E1MFAU]
~z~Jesus, Ash. Where are ya?
[E1MF_CALL1_13:E1MFAU]
~z~Some project on Wardite. Come quick, baby.
[E1MF_CALL1_15:E1MFAU]
~z~I'll try.

[E1MF_AMEET_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Johnny?
[E1MF_AMEET_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Hey Ash. How you doing, baby? 
[E1MF_AMEET_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I been thinking about you, sugar. 
[E1MF_AMEET_7:E1MFAU]
~z~I want you to come see Ray Boccino. He needs some help.
[E1MF_AMEET_9:E1MFAU]
~z~Shit, you owe him money?
[E1MF_AMEET_11:E1MFAU]
~z~It's nothing like that. Come to Drusilla's in Little Italy.

[E1MF_JMEET_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Hey Jim, what's up? 
[E1MF_JMEET_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Same old bullshit, Johnny. Can you come and meet me on Aspdin over in Acter?
[E1MF_JMEET_5:E1MFAU]
~z~Alright, brother. I'll be there. 

[E1MF_APRO_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Hello there, James. How ya doin'? 
[E1MF_APRO_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Getting through it, brother - just about. 
[E1MF_APRO_5:E1MFAU]
~z~Listen, that guy we stole those Angels of Death bikes for, he's got a whole shoppin' list of bikes he wants.
[E1MF_APRO_7:E1MFAU]
~z~You interested in procuring them for him?
[E1MF_APRO_9:E1MFAU]
~z~As long as it ain't gonna get us in the shit with any more dirty cops.
[E1MF_APRO_11:E1MFAU]
~z~Them cops ain't around no more. Get Angus on the wire when you're ready to roll. 
[E1MF_APRO_13:E1MFAU]
~z~He's got the details. So long, brother. 

[E1MF_EPRO_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Jim, brother, what can I do you for? 
[E1MF_EPRO_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Liz Torres needs a hand with something, I told her you'd be down for it.
[E1MF_EPRO_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I guess I do need another crazy motherfucker telling me what to do now that Billy's back on the inside.
[E1MF_EPRO_7:E1MFAU]
~z~I sent them guys, Malc and DeSean, over to her place in South Bohan as well. 
[E1MF_EPRO_9:E1MFAU]
~z~They gonna be able to handle themselves?
[E1MF_EPRO_11:E1MFAU]
~z~Oh, I think so. Don't really know where the other brothers stand, so it's them or no one. 
[E1MF_EPRO_13:E1MFAU]
~z~As long as they can get the imported hairdryers they ride started, it'll work. 

[E1MF_SMEET_1:E1MFAU]
~z~We are moving up in the world, Johnny.
[E1MF_SMEET_3:E1MFAU]
~z~There's a Congressman, needs your help, Tom Stubbs III.
[E1MF_SMEET_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I told you keeping that lawyer around would have its uses.
[E1MF_SMEET_7:E1MFAU]
~z~This guy's at one of them dumb ass gentlemen's clubs in Algonquin - the kind without tits - The Jousters.
[E1MF_SMEET_9:E1MFAU]
~z~Politicians and lawyers? What are we becoming, man? 
[E1MF_SMEET_11:E1MFAU]
~z~Next thing you're gonna tell me we're doing some shit kicking for the LCPD.
[E1MF_SMEET_13:E1MFAU]
~z~It's just opposite the Libertonian. Go pay him a visit, if you're still thinking about your brothers and not just your own ego, that is.

[E1MF_ODDJ_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Klebitz? Klebitz, you there? 
[E1MF_ODDJ_3:E1MFAU]
~z~I'm here. What can I do you for, Congressman?
[E1MF_ODDJ_5:E1MFAU]
~z~Now listen, Klebitz. The tax payer is picking up the bill for this call so I'm going to make it brief. 
[E1MF_ODDJ_7:E1MFAU]
~z~The amount of help I need from a man with your skills has tripled in volume, and that's a conservative estimate. 
[E1MF_ODDJ_9:E1MFAU]
~z~If you're interested in helping me out with this, you can call me and I'll tell you what I need.
[E1MF_ODDJ_11:E1MFAU]
~z~The pay will be more than adequate. 
[E1MF_ODDJ_13:E1MFAU]
~z~Once you go down the dark path, it just keeps goin', don't it, Stubbs? 
[E1MF_ODDJ_15:E1MFAU]
~z~I'll call if I feel the need to keep you in the lifestyle to which you're accustomed. 

[E1MF_GL_1:E1MFAU]
~z~I'm not in the mood to do any killing for the supposed elite today. 
[E1MF_GL_3:E1MFAU]
~z~You're gonna have to get your own hands dirty, Stubbs.
[E1MF_GL_5:E1MFAU]
~z~Oh, spare me the lectures. This is important, Jonathan.
[E1MF_GL_7:E1MFAU]
~z~Important enough for me to come down from my Ivory tower,
[E1MF_GL_9:E1MFAU]
~z~and rub elbows with you blue collar types on the wrong side of the West River. 
[E1MF_GL_11:E1MFAU]
~z~Meet me at your Clubhouse. I drink single malt.

[E1MF_CLEAD_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Jim.
[E1MF_CLEAD_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Johnny, what's up? Some of the brothers, they're asking questions. 
[E1MF_CLEAD_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I mean, when Billy was head of the chapter Brian was doin' his laundry and packing his bongs for him. 
[E1MF_CLEAD_7:E1MFAU]
~z~And you ain't even asked Clay or Terry to help out on a job.
[E1MF_CLEAD_9:E1MFAU]
~z~Okay, man. I'll give one of the boys a call. Get 'em to come along on the next run. Thanks, Jim. 
[E1MF_CLEAD_11:E1MFAU]
~z~These guys wanna help out, man. Out of respect.

[E1MF_AB2_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Johnny. You coming here or what, sugar?
[E1MF_AB2_3:E1MFAU]
~z~What you need, Ash?
[E1MF_AB2_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I can't really talk. Just come over to my place, okay. Hurry, baby. 

[E1MF_BEFAB2_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Johnny. Thought you'd never call.
[E1MF_BEFAB2_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Yeah, we haven't seen one another in a time. 
[E1MF_BEFAB2_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I just see you in my dreams, sugar. 
[E1MF_BEFAB2_7:E1MFAU]
~z~Come on, Ash, give it up. You seriously got time to dream in between your three day ice binges?
[E1MF_BEFAB2_9:E1MFAU]
~z~What's up, Johnny? How you like having Billy back?
[E1MF_BEFAB2_11:E1MFAU]
~z~I like it fine. Look, I got to go. Take care of yourself. 

[E1MF_AFTAB1_1:E1MFAU]
~z~If it isn't my white knight. My saviour. Johnny K.
[E1MF_AFTAB1_3:E1MFAU]
~z~I ain't your saviour, baby. I might have beaten up a few pimps and pushers. 
[E1MF_AFTAB1_5:E1MFAU]
~z~But I'm never gonna save you from yourself. I learned that a long time ago. 
[E1MF_AFTAB1_7:E1MFAU]
~z~That's the old me. I'm clean now. I'm off the meth, and all that shit. 
[E1MF_AFTAB1_9:E1MFAU]
~z~Didn't seem like that when I last saw you. Just checking you're okay. Bye, Ash.

[E1MF_BILLY_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Johnny, baby. I heard Billy's back inside. 
[E1MF_BILLY_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Yeah, he's locked up for a time. 
[E1MF_BILLY_5:E1MFAU]
~z~They might give you two a conjugal visit trailer if you ask the screws nice. 
[E1MF_BILLY_7:E1MFAU]
~z~Fuck you, Johnny. Why you being like that? I just like Billy, that's all.
[E1MF_BILLY_9:E1MFAU]
~z~You like a lot of people, Ash.
[E1MF_BILLY_11:E1MFAU]
~z~Yeah, but I only love you.
[E1MF_BILLY_13:E1MFAU]
~z~Stop saying that. It's meaningless. You don't even know what the words mean. 
[E1MF_BILLY_15:E1MFAU]
~z~Goodbye, Ashley. 

[E1MF_DEAD_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Didn't think I'd hear from you again. 
[E1MF_DEAD_3:E1MFAU]
~z~I didn't think I'd call you. You hear about Billy?
[E1MF_DEAD_5:E1MFAU]
~z~Yeah, I heard. Look, Johnny. Look, have you got any money?
[E1MF_DEAD_7:E1MFAU]
~z~I need forty bucks. I need it real bad, baby.
[E1MF_DEAD_9:E1MFAU]
~z~Not this time. You can kill yourself on your own. Goodbye, Ash. 

[E1MF_DRU_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Ashley? What is it this time?
[E1MF_DRU_3:E1MFAU]
~z~Hey, Johnny boy. It's nothing. I mean it's something, but, but, it ain't like you think.
[E1MF_DRU_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I need you to meet a friend of mine - Ray Boccino.
[E1MF_DRU_7:E1MFAU]
~z~That guinea? Jesus, what you doing with him?
[E1MF_DRU_9:E1MFAU]
~z~We're not doing nothing, Johnny. Nothing we ain't supposed to. I need you to meet him, is all. 
[E1MF_DRU_11:E1MFAU]
~z~We're over at Drusilla's in Little Italy. Can't wait to see you, baby.

[E1MF_NET1_11:E1MFAU]
~z~Ha ha. I'll look at it on the house computer. So long, brother. 

[E1MF_NET2_1:E1MFAU]
~z~Dude?
[E1MF_NET2_3:E1MFAU]
~z~You ever think like you're the only sane person in this fucked up world?
[E1MF_NET2_5:E1MFAU]
~z~I'm hanging around with a reprobate like yourself and my old lady prefers the pipe to me. 
[E1MF_NET2_7:E1MFAU]
~z~I couldn't ever be that deluded.
[E1MF_NET2_9:E1MFAU]
~z~You should see what the world thinks of The Lost MC, man. Some asshole put up a website for us. I've sent you a link.
[E1MF_NET2_11:E1MFAU]
~z~Ha ha. It can't be any more screwed up than what the club's really like. I'll check it out when I'm next in the House. 
[E1MF_NET2_13:E1MFAU]

[E1MF2_TS1_1:E1MF2AU]
~z~Stubbsy!
[E1MF2_TS1_3:E1MF2AU]
~z~Klebitz, listen, briefly wanted to touch base and thank you for your recent assistance. 
[E1MF2_TS1_5:E1MF2AU]
~z~Think it's probably best for both of us to keep some distance now.
[E1MF2_TS1_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~Don't want some fed with a stick up his ass connecting the dots, you know?
[E1MF2_TS1_9:E1MF2AU]
~z~Sure, sure, so are you gonna put me up for membership of your little sauna club, now that I've helped you out?
[E1MF2_TS1_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~Yeah, I don't know what the committee would think of your body art, personal hygiene or "fuck you" attitude, but,
[E1MF2_TS1_13:E1MF2AU]
~z~we'll give it a go. Good luck, sport. 

[E1MF2_TS2_1:E1MF2AU]
~z~Ah, Johnny boy, how's it going out there?
[E1MF2_TS2_3:E1MF2AU]
~z~More shit storm than steam room, Congressman. We weren't all born into money. 
[E1MF2_TS2_5:E1MF2AU]
~z~No, some of us married into it. Ha ha ha.
[E1MF2_TS2_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~And some people killed for it. You got any work for me, man? 
[E1MF2_TS2_9:E1MF2AU]
~z~Well, now that you mention it, there might be a few things that need to be handled discreetly. 
[E1MF2_TS2_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~Call me if you feel up to it, sport. Bye now.

[E1MF2_TS3_1:E1MF2AU]
~z~Johnny, I was just thinking about you.
[E1MF2_TS3_3:E1MF2AU]
~z~I just hope you weren't getting massaged. 
[E1MF2_TS3_5:E1MF2AU]
~z~Listen, Stubbs, things have turned to shit. 
[E1MF2_TS3_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~Yes they have and they might be about to get a whole lot shitter.
[E1MF2_TS3_9:E1MF2AU]
~z~We need to talk. how about I come to you clubhouse?
[E1MF2_TS3_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~Alright, man. I'll see you there. But don't expect no rubdowns. 

[E1MF2_TS4_1:E1MF2AU]
~z~Johnny?
[E1MF2_TS4_3:E1MF2AU]
~z~Congressman. 
[E1MF2_TS4_5:E1MF2AU]
~z~I see your problems have been resolved. Is it back to normal at The Lost Motorcycle Club? 
[E1MF2_TS4_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~No, it ain't, Stubbs. 
[E1MF2_TS4_9:E1MF2AU]
~z~You see, we got a set of codes that mean you can't keep on like nothing's happened after brothers
[E1MF2_TS4_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~turn on brothers and your world turns to shit.
[E1MF2_TS4_13:E1MF2AU]
~z~My, my, A man of principle. Impressive, Klebitz. You must find Liberty City an awful place to live! 
[E1MF2_TS4_15:E1MF2AU]
~z~Such a shame your values are more suited to medieval times.
[E1MF2_TS4_17:E1MF2AU]
~z~Yeah, well, I'd prefer to stand up for something then to chop and change and stab a friend in the back to get ahead. 
[E1MF2_TS4_19:E1MF2AU]
~z~That's why I didn't become a politician. So long, sport.

[E1MF2_OUT_1:E1MF2AU]
~z~Johnny, my brother.

~z~Hey, Angus. You seen much of Billy yet?
[E1MF2_OUT_5:E1MF2AU]
~z~I seen him, yeah. Not much though.
[E1MF2_OUT_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~Well, dude, what do you think? Is he on top of his shit or is he gonna run this club into a hole?
[E1MF2_OUT_9:E1MF2AU]
~z~He's gonna run himself into some hole, I know that. Shit, Billy doesn't really talk to me. 
[E1MF2_OUT_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~I mean he'd hardly make eye contact since I got hurt.
[E1MF2_OUT_13:E1MF2AU]
~z~That's because you're way down in your chair, Angus, and it's hard to see ya.
[E1MF2_OUT_15:E1MF2AU]
~z~Ha ha ha. That'd be a damn sight funnier if I didn't think it was true, John. 
[E1MF2_OUT_17:E1MF2AU]
~z~Billy doesn't see anything that he don't wanna. 
[E1MF2_OUT_19:E1MF2AU]
~z~He'll see anything within smoking, fucking and drinking proximity, but he won't see the two ton truck bearing down on him.
[E1MF2_OUT_21:E1MF2AU]
~z~I get you, man. Later on.

[E1MF2_RESC_1:E1MF2AU]
~z~Jonathan. What's happening in the world of the walking?
[E1MF2_RESC_3:E1MF2AU]
~z~Same old shit, man. Saw Ashley.
[E1MF2_RESC_5:E1MF2AU]
~z~Of course you did. How is the old girl? Still the same spark?
[E1MF2_RESC_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~The only spark left is in her meth pipe. That shit's killing her.
[E1MF2_RESC_9:E1MF2AU]
~z~Fuck, I seen what it does to some of the brothers, man.
[E1MF2_RESC_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~If you love her enough, you can help her.
[E1MF2_RESC_13:E1MF2AU]
~z~It's past that, dude. We're over. Long gone.
[E1MF2_RESC_15:E1MF2AU]
~z~But you're still helping her out of fixes? If it's over you got to end it completely. 
[E1MF2_RESC_17:E1MF2AU]
~z~Yeah, I know it, but you know me, always had a soft spot for someone in trouble. 
[E1MF2_RESC_19:E1MF2AU]

[E1MF2_BILLY_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~I wish it didn't have to be this way, but we don't got much choice.
[E1MF2_BILLY_9:E1MF2AU]
~z~That crown feeling heavy, is it? For what it's worth, I'd follow you, man. I'm sure the other brothers will too. 
[E1MF2_BILLY_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~Those that're worth having behind you, at least.
[E1MF2_BILLY_13:E1MF2AU]
~z~Those that ain't gonna stab me in the back. You gonna go see Billy? I don't think I can after what he said.
[E1MF2_BILLY_15:E1MF2AU]
~z~He wouldn't want me there either. Adios, John boy. Chapter president.

[E1MF2_SHIT_1:E1MF2AU]

~z~... you go and start a civil war.
[E1MF2_SHIT_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~Hey, Brian fucking started it. No, wait, fucking Billy started it.
[E1MF2_SHIT_9:E1MF2AU]
~z~That don't sound very presidential. 
[E1MF2_SHIT_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~Well, I'm president of a bunch of Alderney piss lickers, not the whole nation, 
[E1MF2_SHIT_13:E1MF2AU]
~z~so I'm gonna sound how I like, that being my fucking presidential right. 
[E1MF2_SHIT_15:E1MF2AU]

[E1MF2_END_11:E1MF2AU]
~z~We all do.
[E1MF2_END_13:E1MF2AU]

[E1MF2_END_15:E1MF2AU]
~z~What about Ashley?
[E1MF2_END_17:E1MF2AU]
~z~Ashley? The ice got her good - I finally cut her loose in my head, man.

[E1MF2_BIKES_7:E1MF2AU]
~z~Sure does, Johnny. Well, why don't you have yourself some fun, hmm? Liberty City's a good place for that.

[E1CC_CM01_14:E1CCAUD]
~z~That's got to be creepy. 
[E1CC_CM01_15:E1CCAUD]
~z~You get your homework back and he's drawn a cock on it. 
[E1CC_CM01_16:E1CCAUD]
~z~Do you know what I hate, right? 
[E1CC_CM01_17:E1CCAUD]
~z~I hate those awards ceremonies celebrities have 
[E1CC_CM01_18:E1CCAUD]
~z~to get publicity for themselves. 
[E1CC_CM01_19:E1CCAUD]
~z~They'll have awards for brave children. 
[E1CC_CM01_20:E1CCAUD]
~z~They'll drag up some wee guy with leukemia or something and go 
[E1CC_CM01_21:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Oh look at him. Still keeps smiling, keeps laughing". 
[E1CC_CM01_22:E1CCAUD]
~z~Course he's smiling, he's off his tits on fucking morphine! 
[E1CC_CM01_23:E1CCAUD]
~z~By the way, have you noticed that the word "cancer" 
[E1CC_CM01_24:E1CCAUD]
~z~is on predictive text? 
[E1CC_CM01_25:E1CCAUD]
~z~Who the fuck is texting people the news that they've got cancer? 
[E1CC_CM01_26:E1CCAUD]
~z~"I've got cancer, laugh out loud".
[E1CC_CM01_27:E1CCAUD]
~z~ "Sad face".
[E1CC_CM01_28:E1CCAUD]
~z~Tell you what else is on there - "rape". 
[E1CC_CM01_29:E1CCAUD]
~z~Who the fuck is using that facility? 
[E1CC_CM01_30:E1CCAUD]
~z~Better tell my mum that I won't be home for dinner. 
[E1CC_CM01_31:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Sorry, mum - goin' out raping". 
[E1CC_CM01_32:E1CCAUD]
~z~You ever heard that thing at women's self defense classes they say 
[E1CC_CM01_33:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Don't shout rape, shout fire"?
[E1CC_CM01_34:E1CCAUD]
~z~Cause people will come if it's a fire, 
[E1CC_CM01_35:E1CCAUD]
~z~but they might be frightened if it's a rape. 
[E1CC_CM01_36:E1CCAUD]
~z~Must be quite confusing - for the rapist. 
[E1CC_CM01_37:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Fire, fire". 
[E1CC_CM01_38:E1CCAUD]
~z~"I'm going as quick as I can here"! 
[E1CC_CM01_39:E1CCAUD]
~z~Can I ask you something, pal - 
[E1CC_CM01_40:E1CCAUD]
~z~you worry about the future? 
[E1CC_CM01_41:E1CCAUD]
~z~You should - particularly the next couple of minutes, 
[E1CC_CM01_42:E1CCAUD]
~z~which I'm going to make quite difficult for you. 
[E1CC_CM01_43:E1CCAUD]
~z~Do you not worry about young women getting bigger? 
[E1CC_CM01_44:E1CCAUD]
~z~See like an eighteen year old girl now can be what, 
[E1CC_CM01_45:E1CCAUD]
~z~six foot one, six foot two? 
[E1CC_CM01_46:E1CCAUD]
~z~See by the time you're sixty, 
[E1CC_CM01_47:E1CCAUD]
~z~you trying to shag an eighteen year old girl 
[E1CC_CM01_48:E1CCAUD]
~z~will be like a chihuahua attacking a giraffe. 
[E1CC_CM01_49:E1CCAUD]
~z~By the time you're sixty 
[E1CC_CM01_50:E1CCAUD]
~z~the only way you'll be able to satisfy an eighteen year old girl,
[E1CC_CM01_51:E1CCAUD]
~z~will be if an eighteen year old guy uses you as a strap on. 
[E1CC_CM01_52:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'm not even into young women. 
[E1CC_CM01_53:E1CCAUD]
~z~Even if I could get an eighteen year old to suck my cock, 
[E1CC_CM01_54:E1CCAUD]
~z~she'd be fucking texting someone while she was doing it. 
[E1CC_CM01_55:E1CCAUD]
~z~How do you spell "Awhahahaw"? 
[E1CC_CM01_56:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Feels like he's got cancer". 
[E1CC_CM01_57:E1CCAUD]
~z~Church has got a great thing at the minute. 
[E1CC_CM01_58:E1CCAUD]
~z~They say they don't want sex education in schools,
[E1CC_CM01_59:E1CCAUD]
~z~ because it's like giving the kids pornography. 
[E1CC_CM01_60:E1CCAUD]
~z~As opposed to the traditional Catholic method of educating them - 
[E1CC_CM01_61:E1CCAUD]
~z~of actually fucking them. 
[E1CC_CM01_62:E1CCAUD]
~z~Sex education at my school was a muttered warning about the janitor. 
[E1CC_CM01_63:E1CCAUD]
~z~Anyway, gotta go now - I need a shit!

[E1CC_CM02_1:E1CCAUD]
~z~And now, give it up, for Frankie Boyle!
[E1CC_CM02_2:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hello! 
[E1CC_CM02_3:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hey, how you doing? 
[E1CC_CM02_4:E1CCAUD]
~z~You've made an effort tonight, haven't you, pal? 
[E1CC_CM02_5:E1CCAUD]
~z~Looks like someone shaved a monkey and kicked it through Binco. 
[E1CC_CM02_6:E1CCAUD]
~z~There's a lot of stuff I don't understand about sex, you know,
[E1CC_CM02_7:E1CCAUD]
~z~ like nudie calendars. 
[E1CC_CM02_8:E1CCAUD]
~z~Who's wanking going,
[E1CC_CM02_9:E1CCAUD]
~z~"I can't believe it's Mother's Day". 
[E1CC_CM02_10:E1CCAUD]
~z~I actually lost my virginity to my mother's best friend - 
[E1CC_CM02_11:E1CCAUD]
~z~it was my father.
[E1CC_CM02_12:E1CCAUD]
~z~It was the only time he ever told me he loved me. 
[E1CC_CM02_13:E1CCAUD]
~z~You know how men go,
[E1CC_CM02_14:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Oh, women don't know how to wank us off"?
[E1CC_CM02_15:E1CCAUD]
~z~Don't know why I've done that as an Al Jolson number there -
[E1CC_CM02_16:E1CCAUD]
~z~"They don't know how to wank us off, mammy!" 
[E1CC_CM02_17:E1CCAUD]
~z~Mammy, I wish I hadn't said that. 
[E1CC_CM02_18:E1CCAUD]
~z~Women are actually better with their hands than men, 
[E1CC_CM02_19:E1CCAUD]
~z~I mean admittedly, if you've got a woman who doesn't know what she's doing,
[E1CC_CM02_20:E1CCAUD]
~z~it can be a bit like having someone with Parkinson's disease 
[E1CC_CM02_21:E1CCAUD]
~z~trying to unblock a sink. 
[E1CC_CM02_22:E1CCAUD]
~z~What's a guy who doesn't know what he's doing with his hands like? 
[E1CC_CM02_23:E1CCAUD]
~z~It's like a hungry child wearing oven gloves trying to get a beetroot out of a jar. 
[E1CC_CM02_24:E1CCAUD]
~z~There's stuff you can't say in bed, at all, isn't there?
[E1CC_CM02_25:E1CCAUD]
~z~I've just found this out recently. 
[E1CC_CM02_26:E1CCAUD]
~z~To my cost. 
[E1CC_CM02_27:E1CCAUD]
~z~You know that thing when you're having sex, 
[E1CC_CM02_28:E1CCAUD]
~z~and you sort of know that you're not going to come, 
[E1CC_CM02_29:E1CCAUD]
~z~and you kind of know that they're not going to come either, 
[E1CC_CM02_30:E1CCAUD]
~z~well you're not allowed to go, "let's just call it a draw". 
[E1CC_CM02_31:E1CCAUD]
~z~Don't let men tell you what's sexy, women, 
[E1CC_CM02_32:E1CCAUD]
~z~cause men don't know what's sexy. 
[E1CC_CM02_33:E1CCAUD]
~z~I mean belly button piercings aren't sexy. 
[E1CC_CM02_34:E1CCAUD]
~z~Men just think they are, 
[E1CC_CM02_35:E1CCAUD]
~z~because it reminds them of the staple in a porno mag. 
[E1CC_CM02_36:E1CCAUD]
~z~Never understood how you get into like kinky sex with your partner. 
[E1CC_CM02_37:E1CCAUD]
~z~Must be a point where you bring it up in conversation over dinner, or something. 
[E1CC_CM02_38:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Darling, eh - you know that mug tree we've got in the kitchen..? 
[E1CC_CM02_39:E1CCAUD]
~z~That's the one. 
[E1CC_CM02_40:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'd like to stick it up your arse tonight". 
[E1CC_CM02_41:E1CCAUD]
~z~Is that, is that how you start, 'cause it - 
[E1CC_CM02_42:E1CCAUD]
~z~I mean you'd be frightened that they said no 
[E1CC_CM02_43:E1CCAUD]
~z~but you'd be a lot more frightened that they said yes! 
[E1CC_CM02_44:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Yes, why not! Get the sandwich maker and the lava lamp out. 
[E1CC_CM02_45:E1CCAUD]
~z~Let's make a fucking night of it!"
[E1CC_CM02_46:E1CCAUD]
~z~I've got children now, I've got a wee boy - he's eleven months. 
[E1CC_CM02_47:E1CCAUD]
~z~Starting to get a bit fucking sick of him to be honest.
[E1CC_CM02_48:E1CCAUD]
~z~I've got a wee girl as well, she's four. 
[E1CC_CM02_49:E1CCAUD]
~z~And you know what no one tells you? 
[E1CC_CM02_50:E1CCAUD]
~z~Kids are a fantastic way of meeting women. 
[E1CC_CM02_51:E1CCAUD]
~z~They're a real conversation starter. 
[E1CC_CM02_52:E1CCAUD]
~z~Especially if you get them little cute tops that say "Future DJ", that kind of thing. 
[E1CC_CM02_53:E1CCAUD]
~z~So my daughter's four, I've got her a lovely little pink top that says
[E1CC_CM02_54:E1CCAUD]
~z~"My mummy's dead. 
[E1CC_CM02_55:E1CCAUD]
~z~But daddy's single!" 
[E1CC_CM02_56:E1CCAUD]
~z~The other thing with kids, 
[E1CC_CM02_57:E1CCAUD]
~z~is that sometimes you're just in that kid mode and you don't even have them with you. 
[E1CC_CM02_58:E1CCAUD]
~z~And you'll just say things that have never been said in human history. 
[E1CC_CM02_59:E1CCAUD]
~z~I went to the supermarket a couple of weeks ago. 
[E1CC_CM02_60:E1CCAUD]
~z~I didn't have the kids with me, but I was in that mode, 
[E1CC_CM02_61:E1CCAUD]
~z~and I picked up the cheese and I went "Hello, Mr. Cheese!" 
[E1CC_CM02_62:E1CCAUD]
~z~And this guy beside me got really angry! 
[E1CC_CM02_63:E1CCAUD]
~z~Cause he thought I was talking to him. 
[E1CC_CM02_64:E1CCAUD]
~z~And I had to turn to this guy and go, 
[E1CC_CM02_65:E1CCAUD]
~z~"I wasn't talking to you, mate - I was talking to the cheese".
[E1CC_CM02_66:E1CCAUD]
~z~I was having breakfast with my daughter a couple of weeks ago, 
[E1CC_CM02_67:E1CCAUD]
~z~and she goes "Daddy, what's the best thing in the world?" 
[E1CC_CM02_68:E1CCAUD]
~z~So I didn't even have to think about it, right, I said 
[E1CC_CM02_69:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Darling, you're the best thing in the world. 
[E1CC_CM02_70:E1CCAUD]
~z~I don't even have to think about it. It's definitely you". 
[E1CC_CM02_71:E1CCAUD]
~z~And she sat there for a bit, and then she went
[E1CC_CM02_72:E1CCAUD]
~z~"For me it's sausages".
[E1CC_CM02_73:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hey, a pleasure talking to you motherfuckers!

[E1CC_CM03_1:E1CCAUD]
~z~Split Sides Comedy Club welcomes, Frankie Boyle!
[E1CC_CM03_2:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hello! 
[E1CC_CM03_3:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hey, shut it pal. 
[E1CC_CM03_4:E1CCAUD]
~z~You'll leave here with an asshole like a yawning hippo's mouth. 
[E1CC_CM03_5:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'm quite a grumpy bastard. 
[E1CC_CM03_6:E1CCAUD]
~z~I drink, er, that Electrolyte drink to do the shows. 
[E1CC_CM03_7:E1CCAUD]
~z~It's good that they've finally managed to can anxiety, isn't it? 
[E1CC_CM03_8:E1CCAUD]
~z~It's good that there's a drink that gives me the resting heart rate 
[E1CC_CM03_9:E1CCAUD]
~z~of a serial killer ejaculating into a school sock. 
[E1CC_CM03_10:E1CCAUD]
~z~I don't drink. 
[E1CC_CM03_11:E1CCAUD]
~z~My best mate gave up the same time as me 
[E1CC_CM03_12:E1CCAUD]
~z~and he said it was because he could never imagine anything worse 
[E1CC_CM03_13:E1CCAUD]
~z~than waking up in the morning with less money than you thought you had 
[E1CC_CM03_14:E1CCAUD]
~z~and a really sore head. 
[E1CC_CM03_15:E1CCAUD]
~z~I said, "It could be worse; 
[E1CC_CM03_16:E1CCAUD]
~z~you could wake up with much more money than you thought you had. 
[E1CC_CM03_17:E1CCAUD]
~z~And a really sore arse." 
[E1CC_CM03_18:E1CCAUD]
~z~When I was at school, I could never work out how to get girls' bras undone. 
[E1CC_CM03_19:E1CCAUD]
~z~I just couldn't do it. 
[E1CC_CM03_20:E1CCAUD]
~z~And then eventually I realized that these girls were wearing a different type of bra...
[E1CC_CM03_21:E1CCAUD]
~z~from my Gran. 
[E1CC_CM03_22:E1CCAUD]
~z~If you don't like that, you're going to fucking hate this next bit. 
[E1CC_CM03_23:E1CCAUD]
~z~The oldest woman ever to give birth gave birth this year. 
[E1CC_CM03_24:E1CCAUD]
~z~She was 70. 
[E1CC_CM03_25:E1CCAUD]
~z~I imagine at 70, the baby didn't have to force its way out. 
[E1CC_CM03_26:E1CCAUD]
~z~It spent the last three months bungee jumping. 
[E1CC_CM03_27:E1CCAUD]
~z~Every time she went for a shit, it had to brace itself. 
[E1CC_CM03_28:E1CCAUD]
~z~Can you imagine what having a baby must have done
[E1CC_CM03_29:E1CCAUD]
~z~to the state of a 70-year-old's fanny? 
[E1CC_CM03_30:E1CCAUD]
~z~Absolutely nothing at all. 
[E1CC_CM03_31:E1CCAUD]
~z~No, I'm sure it was actually a magical moment. 
[E1CC_CM03_32:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'd love to have been there when her dust broke. 
[E1CC_CM03_33:E1CCAUD]
~z~I love old people, I do, 
[E1CC_CM03_34:E1CCAUD]
~z~but I hate it when they're always boasting about what they did in the war. 
[E1CC_CM03_35:E1CCAUD]
~z~Come on, Grandad, we're trying to have Christmas dinner here. 
[E1CC_CM03_36:E1CCAUD]
~z~Nobody gives a fuck how many Jews you killed. 
[E1CC_CM03_37:E1CCAUD]
~z~I suppose the only thing I don't like about old people is that, 
[E1CC_CM03_38:E1CCAUD]
~z~when you have anal sex with them, there's almost no grip. 
[E1CC_CM03_39:E1CCAUD]
~z~You'd get more purchase fucking their open grave. 
[E1CC_CM03_40:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'm trying to think if I've got any cheerful jokes at all. 
[E1CC_CM03_41:E1CCAUD]
~z~Oh yes! As a man, never get a Brazilian. 
[E1CC_CM03_42:E1CCAUD]
~z~Because, when you get a hard-on, you look like a sundial at noon. 
[E1CC_CM03_43:E1CCAUD]
~z~You know my favorite time of year? Halloween. 
[E1CC_CM03_44:E1CCAUD]
~z~Halloween, a wonderful time of year for the agoraphobic pedophile. 
[E1CC_CM03_45:E1CCAUD]
~z~They're being delivered to the door, in little costumes? 
[E1CC_CM03_46:E1CCAUD]
~z~How many dead hookers can you fit in a garage? 
[E1CC_CM03_47:E1CCAUD]
~z~Another two, if I move my bike. 
[E1CC_CM03_48:E1CCAUD]
~z~See, I think a lot of this stuff with offensiveness in comedy comes from the fact 
[E1CC_CM03_49:E1CCAUD]
~z~that we're often talking about big stereotypes and generalizations. 
[E1CC_CM03_50:E1CCAUD]
~z~And they're not always true, are they? 
[E1CC_CM03_51:E1CCAUD]
~z~So, for example, I've got a friend does a routine about,
[E1CC_CM03_52:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Oh, don't you hate it when your partner comes to bed and they're cold, 
[E1CC_CM03_53:E1CCAUD]
~z~and they try to get heat off you?" 
[E1CC_CM03_54:E1CCAUD]
~z~And I always think, well, what if you're a necrophiliac? 
[E1CC_CM03_55:E1CCAUD]
~z~Maybe you love it when they're cold? 
[E1CC_CM03_56:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Oh, that's brilliant, you're freezing. 
[E1CC_CM03_57:E1CCAUD]
~z~Don't move a fucking muscle. 
[E1CC_CM03_58:E1CCAUD]
~z~I want it to be realistic - 
[E1CC_CM03_59:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'm gonna open your arse cheeks with a car jack."
[E1CC_CM03_60:E1CCAUD]
~z~See, political correctness has changed everything, hasn't it? 
[E1CC_CM03_61:E1CCAUD]
~z~I mean, people forget that even political correctness itself 
[E1CC_CM03_62:E1CCAUD]
~z~used to be called spastic gay talk. 
[E1CC_CM03_63:E1CCAUD]
~z~Apparently, at Christmas now we're not supposed to say fairy lights anymore 
[E1CC_CM03_64:E1CCAUD]
~z~because it might be homophobic. 
[E1CC_CM03_65:E1CCAUD]
~z~Apparently, now we've got to call them poof lanterns. 
[E1CC_CM03_66:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hey, it's been a pleasure. 
[E1CC_CM03_67:E1CCAUD]
~z~Stay black!

[E1CC_CM04_1:E1CCAUD]
~z~All the way from Glasgow, Frankie Boyle!
[E1CC_CM04_2:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hello! 
[E1CC_CM04_3:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hey, is this your woman, pal? 
[E1CC_CM04_4:E1CCAUD]
~z~She looks like she could rip you apart like a fucking chicken wing. 
[E1CC_CM04_5:E1CCAUD]
~z~Does he touch the sides? 
[E1CC_CM04_6:E1CCAUD]
~z~When he does, do you vibrate and your nose lights up? 
[E1CC_CM04_7:E1CCAUD]
~z~Read this great thing recently, 
[E1CC_CM04_8:E1CCAUD]
~z~said that scientists are going to start treating alcoholism with LSD. 
[E1CC_CM04_9:E1CCAUD]
~z~That's going to make tramps very different people. 
[E1CC_CM04_10:E1CCAUD]
~z~Any spare change, pal? I've got a unicorn to feed.
[E1CC_CM04_11:E1CCAUD]
~z~Apparently, scientists have come up with a condom for premature ejaculation. 
[E1CC_CM04_12:E1CCAUD]
~z~And, basically, it's got an anesthetic in the lining and it makes you numb 
[E1CC_CM04_13:E1CCAUD]
~z~and you can last for longer. 
[E1CC_CM04_14:E1CCAUD]
~z~Or, you can wear it inside out, 
[E1CC_CM04_15:E1CCAUD]
~z~and you don't have to wake anybody up. 
[E1CC_CM04_16:E1CCAUD]
~z~Mollis is overrated, isn't it? 
[E1CC_CM04_17:E1CCAUD]
~z~Mollis actually takes half an hour to have any effect. 
[E1CC_CM04_18:E1CCAUD]
~z~I often find that, in that time, 
[E1CC_CM04_19:E1CCAUD]
~z~the woman has managed to wriggle free. 
[E1CC_CM04_20:E1CCAUD]
~z~You ever heard that science thing that the human female 
[E1CC_CM04_21:E1CCAUD]
~z~has exactly the same pheromone scent as an orangutan female? 
[E1CC_CM04_22:E1CCAUD]
~z~It was news to me. 
[E1CC_CM04_23:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'll never wear a blindfold again. 
[E1CC_CM04_24:E1CCAUD]
~z~They told me she was European. 
[E1CC_CM04_25:E1CCAUD]
~z~You ever heard that science thing that, 
[E1CC_CM04_26:E1CCAUD]
~z~if you put a frog into boiling water it'll jump out, 
[E1CC_CM04_27:E1CCAUD]
~z~but, if you put it into cold water and you heat the water up, 
[E1CC_CM04_28:E1CCAUD]
~z~the frog won't realize and it'll die? 
[E1CC_CM04_29:E1CCAUD]
~z~Or, to put it another way, scientists have got a lot of fucking time on their hands. 
[E1CC_CM04_30:E1CCAUD]
~z~"Shall we have a go at curing cancer? "
[E1CC_CM04_31:E1CCAUD]
~z~"No, I'm going to see how many fruit pastilles it takes to choke a kestrel. "
[E1CC_CM04_32:E1CCAUD]
~z~Do you know what I hate? 
[E1CC_CM04_33:E1CCAUD]
~z~Charity. Charity doesn't work, right? 
[E1CC_CM04_34:E1CCAUD]
~z~Because we want it to work won't make it fucking work. 
[E1CC_CM04_35:E1CCAUD]
~z~You might want to send money to people in Africa. 
[E1CC_CM04_36:E1CCAUD]
~z~That money takes no account of cultural difference. 
[E1CC_CM04_37:E1CCAUD]
~z~It takes no account of the reality of those people's lives. 
[E1CC_CM04_38:E1CCAUD]
~z~If you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. 
[E1CC_CM04_39:E1CCAUD]
~z~If you give him a fishing rod, he'll break it up for firewood. 
[E1CC_CM04_40:E1CCAUD]
~z~Or maybe swap it for a fish. 
[E1CC_CM04_41:E1CCAUD]
~z~I hate that fat fuck, John Hunter. 
[E1CC_CM04_42:E1CCAUD]
~z~You're talking about a guy who's so fat 
[E1CC_CM04_43:E1CCAUD]
~z~he can't wear a belt and a tie on the same day 
[E1CC_CM04_44:E1CCAUD]
~z~or he'll turn into sausages. 
[E1CC_CM04_45:E1CCAUD]
~z~I hate property programs. 
[E1CC_CM04_46:E1CCAUD]
~z~I saw one the other day, right. 
[E1CC_CM04_47:E1CCAUD]
~z~It said - if someone's coming round to view the house, 
[E1CC_CM04_48:E1CCAUD]
~z~remember to open your curtains and tidy up. 
[E1CC_CM04_49:E1CCAUD]
~z~Oh, thanks for that. 
[E1CC_CM04_50:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'd been planning on redecorating using diarrhea pills and stencils. 
[E1CC_CM04_51:E1CCAUD]
~z~Then shaving the word 'Welcome' into my fucking dog's back. 
[E1CC_CM04_52:E1CCAUD]
~z~That's a joke, I don't have a dog, obviously.
[E1CC_CM04_53:E1CCAUD]
~z~Having pets is fucking tragic. 
[E1CC_CM04_54:E1CCAUD]
~z~Having a pet is basically saying, 
[E1CC_CM04_55:E1CCAUD]
~z~"I have tried to find love among my own species and I have failed. 
[E1CC_CM04_56:E1CCAUD]
~z~I've had to fall back on the less judgmental animal kingdom."
[E1CC_CM04_57:E1CCAUD]
~z~Is there anything sadder than seeing someone with a dog picking up dog shit? 
[E1CC_CM04_58:E1CCAUD]
~z~I suppose, maybe someone without a dog? 
[E1CC_CM04_59:E1CCAUD]
~z~Vet - that's a job I'd like to have. 
[E1CC_CM04_60:E1CCAUD]
~z~I don't know how long I could be a vet 
[E1CC_CM04_61:E1CCAUD]
~z~before I got bored and started fucking stuff. 
[E1CC_CM04_62:E1CCAUD]
~z~I'd fuck an owl, 
[E1CC_CM04_63:E1CCAUD]
~z~because it could give you eye contact whatever position you took it in. 
[E1CC_CM04_64:E1CCAUD]
~z~Or fuck a kitten. 
[E1CC_CM04_65:E1CCAUD]
~z~Imagine having sex with something you actually wanted to cuddle afterwards? 
[E1CC_CM04_66:E1CCAUD]
~z~Hey, have a great weekend!
