I've got a little surprise for you. You looked lonely, so I got you some company.

[DRK1A2]
Unfortunately the Innocentz thought better of it and locked him up.

[DRK1A3]
You're gonna have to bust him out!

[DRK2A1]
Well what do you think of your new friend? You look good together, Cash, really you do.

[DRK2A2]
I'll only open any gates if he's with you, alive and well.

[DRK2A3]
Now get going. Entertain me.

[DRK3A1]
You're going to have to think of a way of separating these guys and picking them off one by one…

[DRK4A1]
I told you. Get that hobo safely to the gate and I'll buzz you through.

[DRK5A1]
I thought this graveyard would make a great location for a shoot-out - what do you think, Cash?

[DRK6A1]
Aw, Cash, I'm disappointed, really I am,

[DRK6A2]
is that any way to care for your bestest buddy?!

[DRK6B1]
Cash! You let that poor man down in the biggest possible way.

[DRK6B2]
I only hope you can live with yourself.

[DRK6C1]
You blew it Cash! All you had to do was look out for someone for ten minutes and you blew it...

[DRK6D1]
Cash, baby, you let them kill your friend

[DRK6D2]
and you made such a lovely couple!

[DRK7A1]
See that old house? That's where you're headed.

[DRK8A1]
You're doing good Cash, you'll need to go through the pedestrian tunnel - find it.

[DRK9A1]
Aren't you forgetting someone, Cash?

[DRK9B1]
Hey, what about your new buddy - you're not going to abandon him are you?

[DRK9C1]
You've left your new chum behind - friends are supposed to look out for each other!

[DRK9D1]
Is that how you treat your pals? Leave 'em to rot?

[DRK10A1]
Cash! Your buddy's getting the crap kicked out of him!

[DRK10B1]
You've got to learn how to care for others, Cash - Your new friend's in trouble!

[DRK10C1]
Heads up, Cash, you better go rescue your new friend!

[DRK10D1]
Oh dear, looks like your new bunk buddy's run into a few Hunters!

[DRK11A1]
You know the deal, Cash. I open the door when I see your friend.

[DRK11B1]
When I see your smelly friend I'll open the door.

[DRK11C1]
I'm not blind Cash, where's your hobo buddy?
