Acclaimed movie maker Lionel Starkweather has been found dead today

[MPG2]
along with several of his bodyguards, at his estate at the Wapona Hills residential district.

[MPG3]
In what investigators are calling a bloody vendetta,

[MPG4]
An unknown assailant infiltrated the compound, killing Starkweather,

[MPG5]
but more interestingly, leading police to the site of a snuff film ring being run from the estate's confines.

[MPG6]
Linked to this ring is Carcer City's own police chief Gary Schaffer,

[MPG7]
whose lawyer stated that he intends to plead not guilty.

[MPG8]
